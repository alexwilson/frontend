            Security is an area of technology & business development which is broadly misunderstood. The risks in technology
            estates alone tend to be far broader than people understand, and many organisations are being caught out everyday
            by increasingly advanced threats. Working independently or with you and your teams, <strong>I can help you find
            and mitigate your risks</strong>.

            Designing software to effectively meet our user and business needs is hard: There's so much noise around patterns,
            technologies and tools that it's easy to forget what's really important. <em>Technology tends to be presented as a
            solution before we discover the problem</em>.<br />
            As user-needs and organisations evolve, the approach that worked yesterday might be a blocker today. From
            microservices through to mobile applications, <strong>I can help design/adapt architecture and its design process
            to empower everybody and to work for your business</strong>.<br />
