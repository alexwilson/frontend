# Content

This is a static package containing all of the content available on `alexwilson.tech`.

## Why a package?
This has been extracted as a package to help separate things out from Gatsby a little bit, and to make implementing a CMS easier.

## What's wrong with Gatsby?
Nothing!  I love Gatsby, and I still miss Jekyll.  Both have proven fantastic tools which I continue to use in other places.

Static site generators are fantastic but I don't enjoy trying to author content in Markdown and also having a codebase open at the time.  IDEs open to a source-code project encourage me to think of code, and not words, and leave a lot to the imagination.

More exciting opportunities by playing around with metadata & formatting are also rather hard, as the Markdown standard is designed (mostly) to produce simpler web pages.
