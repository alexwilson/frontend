March has been a blur. At the beginning of the month I was away adventuring in Hong Kong, and as I write this, I am in London about to begin a new adventure.

Friday the 29th marked the final chapter of my time at [Bluetel](https://bluetel.co.uk/) (“Alexit”) and on Monday [I start a new chapter at the Financial Times](https://mobile.twitter.com/antoligy/status/1098993524459089921).

A lot happened this month and I think that at least some of it is worth writing about so I have populated my newly-minted “Writing” Trello board with a few ideas. _At least, that’s my excuse for not cleaning-up/publishing any notes._

I wasn't planning on saying anything else in this post, but: In just a few days, Google are sunsetting Google Inbox, which is a huge shame. [I guess they weren’t really trying to hide that it had dropped in priority though](https://twitter.com/antoligy/status/1112458207358869515).
