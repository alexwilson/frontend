Our office is now twice as big as it was when I joined and I love finding interesting nooks for focus work.</li>\n<li>What can only be described as the helicopter version of a motorcade flew of my office a few times this week.  It was the US state visit.  Strange thinking about it.</li>\n<li>I re-did the AI agent stuff from the other week, and made it considerably simpler/better.  More extensible, if you will.  Now it outputs a pretty report and I'm delighted with it.</li>\n<li>During the week I got some bad news.  It wasn’t unexpected, but it did still hurt.  But it’s in these moments when our real friends reveal themselves, and we christened a wonderful new bolt-hole I scouted (but hadn’t needed) inches away from my favouite photo-spot of Tokyo tower.</li>\n<li>Had a few extremely-basic-yet-coherent conversations in Japanese which was immensely rewarding.  I can’t have imagined being able to do this a year ago, but I still would give anything to make faster progress.</li>\n<li>At the weekend I woke up bright and early for a trip to the boonies to do some walking and to look at a cave.  The cave was just a cave, but the surrounding countryside was beautiful: Autumn is my favourite season in Japan.</li>\n<li>This involved a two-hour wait for a bus in an abandoned town.  A gang of monkeys made their presence known, and slowly moved in closer and closer to the bus-stop.  Luckily the bus arrived before they could make their intentions known.</li>\n<li>Dinner in Shinjuku followed by an adventure in nichome and a call with the one and only TC.</li>\n<li>Went to Analog market which was less about audio than all of the publicity made it seem.  Made for a nice pivot into some overdue shopping in Ginza.</li>\n<li>Hawaiian burgers are alright.</li>\n<li>Time to start thinking about yearnotes, eh?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w44-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 45, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 45, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"A new floor opened at work this week, bringing a few cool new things including an automatic coffee machine.
