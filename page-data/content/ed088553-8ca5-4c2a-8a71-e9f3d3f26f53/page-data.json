It’ll require a few passes to get right so I’m publishing early &#x26; often: Inaccuracies open a feedback loop for both improving the mapping, and, for finding areas for future improvements.  I'm starting to understand how governance can work.</li>\n<li>Papers Club reviewed <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction\">MCP</a> this week.  What I like is that there aren’t any new fundamental ideas: You aggregate APIs.  What <em>is</em> new: A new class of security vulnerability.  There’s lots of room for interesting development there.</li>\n<li>Had a first-pass at setting both my objectives and my expectations for the rest of the year.  It means doing a lot of (realistic) thinking about further developing as an IC, which is exciting.</li>\n<li>Reconnected with some old coworkers in <a href=\"https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1310/A131002/13214764/\">the best English-style pub I’ve been to yet</a> - which was an absolute blast - with a <em>very</em> passable fish &#x26; chips.  We started late, so I wrapped early to catch a train and make a phone-call.</li>\n<li>Met up with some cool people in a Ginza sub-basement to play a few practice rounds of Tennis &#x26; Golf.  There were prizes but I didn’t win any.  My <em>golf swing</em> is better than I remember, but I much preferred the tennis. Which needs a lot of work.</li>\n<li>Always say yes to rainforest tea!  Especially when it tastes like strawberries!</li>\n<li>Yakiniku on Friday turned into regret on a Saturday.  Made some friends in a HUB along the way.</li>\n<li>The weekend marked many chores in the hood - instigated by a different important phone-call - and a fair amount of running: My recovery is getting better, but the weather really isn’t making it easy.</li>\n<li>Closed the week at a house-warming with the KP massive.  I love seeing how other people decorate.  Never thought I'd be talking about Product Validation at a house-warming.  Welcome to being 30, I guess.</li>\n<li>Confession is good for the soul.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w27-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 27, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 27, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Fuelled by the introspection and retrospection of the last two weeks, I felt an enjoyable clarity all week.
