The trains are not ready, and on Monday evening they give out.</li>\n<li>In sharp contrast, the office feels quiet - putting into perspective my deep-dive into Google Drive’s permissions and API.</li>\n<li>Drive API?  Not a fan.  The documentation is riddled with random jargon, implied behaviours and inconsistencies.  I learn a lot about things that even Google just aren’t able to do, and CR confirms that fixing or adding a few of them are “on their roadmap... eventually”.  And that some things aren’t.</li>\n<li>I hardly sleep on Tuesday night for reasons I never fully work out, but it seems like there’s a correlation with the pollen forecast?  Wednesday goes OK but I feel fragile.  But I give up on spot plans to travel at the weekend.</li>\n<li>Feeling the telltale signs of seasonal allergies, I resume Fexofenadine.</li>\n<li>Over the week I fiddle with a research project, where I attempt to model matches in a popular e-sport on a social graph to identify latent trends.  The form of the data, the vast number of players and the low rate-limits of official APIs lead to what I’ll generously call: “A disproportionate return on investment of my time”.  But I do now have a few cool graphs.  And soon it will work.</li>\n<li>A few small-ish things that people do (and don’t do) really get to me, enough to prompt reflection that I here am writing about doing, but will (probably) never share.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://katzenjammers.co.uk/\">Katzenjammers</a> for dinner one evening with MS.  The pairing of a Hofbräu Weissbier and a schnitzel heavy on the salad reminds me that beer <em>can</em> taste good, a fact that will become more relevant later.</li>\n<li>Hi, it’s later now. Over the week, I had a few of the usual names you see on the taps. Learned that Local Pub™ staff think I’m a Camden Hells regular. But: I really don’t enjoy these, it’s the company that keeps me locked in. I suspect I’m not alone - because - who <em>really</em> enjoys IPAs?  I’m going to try harder to stick to the complex-for-London order of a whiskey-soda.</li>\n<li>Friday evening hits, and for lack of the previously-cancelled plan to travel to Cordoba, I head to Euston and pick up tickets to Birmingham.  The journey is really smooth.  We arrive early.  It’s late out, so I order a cab, and I’m really impressed? New car smell. The doors slides open welcomingly on their own. The seats are separated and have arm-rests.  I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.  We head out of the “drop-n-go” zone, and immediately drive past a <em>surprisingly</em> agile shirtless man fighting kids clad in hoodies.  There we go.</li>\n<li>Lots of small things happened over the weekend: The <a href=\"https://www.birminghamhippodrome.com/calendar/birmingham-weekender-2024/\">Birmingham Weekender</a> was on, so I saw lots of small pop-up events with my sister including free-style breakdancing (easily better than olympic-grade) and a few mini-concerts.  We watched Deadpool, and while some of it held up <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/d5d8284c-ca98-4242-bfb0-2ba590465b87\">the audience was decidedly less animated than the first time I saw it</a>.</li>\n<li>Picked up a few of my old faves while in town; Parisian from <a href=\"https://www.andersonandhill.co.uk/\">Anderson &#x26; Hill</a> and a three-roast rice (三寶飯?) from Peach Garden.  The latter is delicious and is a LOT of food, but it’s pricier <a href=\"https://www.thegoodfoodguide.co.uk/editorial/features/Birmingham-on-a-plate\">it once was</a>.  Hit up Royal Watan on Sunday for an “Alex special”.</li>\n<li>On the train down I watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12718300\">Confess, Fletch (2024)</a> which featured a solid Hamm/Slattery dynamic whilst also making me feel clever, so it gets an absolutely solid 3.5/5.</li>\n<li>There’s heaps of emergent symmetry this week relative to the <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f27fe5f-243f-4b65-8e14-c8236ec36914\">same time last year</a>.</li>\n<li>We watched the first half of the new season of Emily in Paris...  What a strange point to cut-off the series?  Also that hat at the masquerade ball had major Scary Movie 3 vibes.</li>\n<li>On top of making a “/now/“ page and a blogroll, I’m toying with making a page that is just a list of places and things I <em>really</em> like.  Is this is a bad idea?</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"There’s a buzz in London’s rarefied air this week, and it isn’t the Notting Hill Carnival: Swifties from all over are in town to see the…"},"slug":"/content/50d1a37a-2d49-44a1-a3ef-d85460324df1"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"50d1a37a-2d49-44a1-a3ef-d85460324df1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1302009070","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
