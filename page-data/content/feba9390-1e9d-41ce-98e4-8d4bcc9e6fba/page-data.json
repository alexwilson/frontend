Turns out that travel can be dangerous after-all.</li>\n<li>After not running much during the trip and then staying mostly indoors for a week, I ran <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/8042925740\">once</a> this week and it was a real struggle. Lesson learned: stick to the habit - <em>even while travelling</em>. The upshot is that all my health stats are still tracking up.</li>\n<li>At work I spent a lot of time on recruitment-shaped activities for a few roles. On top of going through - <em>a lot</em> - of CVs, I designed a new interview process for a specialised role, leaning heavily on behavioural questions (with a few discussion-based technical questions) and <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/interviewing-fairly.html\">this GDS-inspired technique</a> and so far it’s performing quite well.</li>\n<li>In the evenings I’ve split my time between writing, coursework and drinking. Hoping to publish a few blog posts over the course of the rest of the year.</li>\n<li>This term I’m using three languages as part of my course - Python &#x26; JavaScript, which I’m comfortable with, and C++17 which is mostly new to me. Learning a new language, even formally (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36708350-beginning-c-17\">with this textbook</a>), is pretty refreshing so far.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10857160\">She-Hulk</a> finale was … <em>okay</em>. It happened just in time for <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11704040\">Love Is Blind Season 3</a> to start airing. At this point, it feels a bit rote and the editing is predictably excellent. Quite pleased that a few bets/calls I made early on have panned out so far. The tears thing was weird, wasn’t it?</li>\n<li>I stopped enjoying Twitter two years ago. Returning from a break the algorithm began working against me and my posts reached fewer people. Meanwhile my feed included negativity, drama and attention-grabbing threads - <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/viralpolitics\">because they drive engagement</a>. Musk’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation\">hostile takeover</a> this week doesn’t change much for me, I’ll still be disillusioned-yet-reachable there. However you can now also <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@alexwilson\">find me on Mastodon</a>, and of course, here (<a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/feed.xml\">via RSS</a>).</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Reader, I ventured back into the world this week after recovering from - something - I caught returning from Bulgaria.
