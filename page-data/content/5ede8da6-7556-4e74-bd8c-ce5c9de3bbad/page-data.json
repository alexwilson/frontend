But they're over now, <em>for now</em>.</li>\n<li>On Monday, in part to celebrate handing in my first two midterm assignments, and in part because I'd already made these plans, I went to see the new Mission Impossible movie with AD and CR.  It was good!  Lots of build, especially in the run-up to Part 2.  I couldn't stop noticing that in every shot Tom Cruise managed to make himself look so tall.</li>\n<li>Spent a lot of time this week talking to people about how to staff an upcoming technical strategy initiative.  And then the rest doing the first of a few interviews with people who worked on similar projects in the past, where I learned loads.  A major theme was finding novel ways to remove the felt constraints of our organisational structure - moving past <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\">Conway's law</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/rolling-out-cms-pandemic/\">Spark team</a> ran a hack-week this week, and I joined their presentation on Friday to see some of the results.  All great stuff, but my favourites were an experimental implementation of push-notifications (which is dope, and based on service workers!) and the presentation for an accessibility hack which explored how to make in-article comments accessible.</li>\n<li>Another big thing this week is that I now own a microwave.  Yes, I know, not really a thing, but it feels big.  By making food marginally quicker to prepare I'm hoping to rule out any remaining use-case for takeaways.</li>\n<li>On Friday, walking past the Market Porter (en-route to Katzenjammers, obviously) one Dr Mark tapped me on the shoulder and pointed me to a bearded man standing to the side.  Turns out it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty8MZKi4Ou8\">Matt Berry</a>, on a date.  Being on a date we couldn't disturb him, but it really made my week.</li>\n<li>Midterms were stressful.  Both projects required quite a lot of me, and I ended up with a fully-fledged blogging app built from (more or less) scratch.  The final stretch of making sure I offered all functionality was a slog and I wish I'd written some tests early on.  Also very gratifying to build an entire web application from scratch in such a short timespan — it's amazing how quickly these projects go when you've got access to a database.  Most of my side-projects are so complicated because databases are expensive.</li>\n<li>Managed to also go to a BBQ at the weekend, but skip the actual BBQ bit and instead go to a pub in the Streatham rain.  Very nice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w29.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 29, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 29, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"Another busy week, week 2 of midterms.
