This week I've been only reflecting on where to draw the line in applications logic.</li>\n<li>\"Self-documenting code\" usually <em>isn't</em>.  By all means we should continue writing <a href=\"https://alexkondov.com/one-line-of-code/\">delightful APIs</a>, but... they aren't ever a replacement for also writing stuff down.</li>\n<li>Sometimes slightly simpler, less abstracted code (think, fewer layers) buys us time &#x26; space to write things down: In plain language.</li>\n<li>With both approaches we have a looming maintenance problem: As both domain logic &#x26; implementation evolve over time, so too must any abstractions &#x26; written documentation.</li>\n<li>The first thing to be suspended (and rarely resumed) in projects under increased pressure isn't tests.  It's documentation.</li>\n<li>Abstractions tend to be adjusted in ways that quickly incur technical debt, but, perhaps the documentation debt is easier to pay back - and sooner?</li>\n<li>Since last year I've been increasingly valuing a well-written PRD &#x26; ERD over almost any other kind of project artefact. Something similar, closer to the code, more refined than types ... that feels like a good place to be.</li>\n<li>Anyway, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well\">How To Edit</a>, <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-edit/\">On Writing Well</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://docsfordevelopers.com/\">Docs for Developers</a> are now at the top of my technical reading list.  If you have any comments or suggestions, please send them my way!  There's a better write-up in here for sure (at least after I learn how to write).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Towards the Great Apartment Furniture Fetch-Quest of '21, on Saturday my friend Laura took me shopping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We trekked through most of central London — at least, from Kings Cross to \"Marble Arch Hill\" — trying to track down an Xbox Series X.</li>\n<li>Good lord I had no idea that skating was: A) so popular B) so expensive??</li>\n<li>Marble Arch Hill?  What a let-down.  It isn't even really that good of a view?</li>\n<li>Oh yeah, and the London Transport Museum are still doing tours.  We tried (and failed) to walk into one.  Potentially the most exclusive activity in London right now.</li>\n<li>In the end we sort-of gave up and went to the Microsoft <del>Store</del> Experience Centre.  Microsoft weren't lying: it was an experience.</li>\n<li>Strangely reminiscent of an Apple Store.  But like, not.  Because it was an experience.  Honest!</li>\n<li>I now have an Xbox Series S: Bring on Perfect Dark!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next week's chapter: <em>I don't know yet</em>.  I made some other less exciting progress (most notably: getting a bed &#x26; sofa and metric-tonne of cookware).  There's also some Wayfair stuff en-route.  Maybe I should just go to IKEA already?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ellen Allien, MARRØN &#x26; Rebekah really know how to push a Funktion One set-up to its limits, as I have recently learned.</li>\n<li><strong>But</strong> the Teenage Engineering OB-4 really packs a punch too: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexWilsonV1/status/1431391545744310272\">One recently arrived, and, good god am I <strong>obsessed</strong>??</a></li>\n<li>In related news I have resumed my obsession with Teenage Engineering equipment and modular synth.  This may be a bad thing.</li>\n<li>Did I miss something?  Music festivals are somehow back in full force.  This weekend I gawked at the line-ups of Reading Festival, Junction 2, Field Day &#x26; Creamfields in extreme envy.\n<ul>\n<li>Bicep's performance at Field Day got posted to Instagram a lot, and really stood out:  Sharp light-work + lasers &#x26; really crisp synth-work.  Crikey.</li>\n<li>This whole pandemic thing really kind-of sucks.  It'd be nice to have been able to go to <em>any</em> of these guilt-free.</li>\n<li><em>(Being double-booked didn't help.)</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, have you seen the <a href=\"https://www.kathmanduandbeyond.com/ukrainian-institute-scientific-technological-research-development-kiev/\">Ukranian Institute of Scientific and Technological Research and Development</a>? Gosh that building is wild. In a really good way. It's like a flying saucer landed on top of a bus station and this is honestly all of the commentary I am capable of providing because I don't really know what else to think.</p>","excerpt":"Reader, honestly, this week, it's been a little bit rough?
