Huge thank-you to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/efinlay24\">Euan</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/\">Anna</a> respectively for the tickets - I otherwise wouldn't have gone, which would have been a <em>huge</em> mistake.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://leaddev.com/\">LeadDev</a>’s name is definitely unintuitive: I’d recommend it to <strong>all</strong> mid &#x26; senior level engineers as a flavour of what sorts of things tech-leads &#x26; engineering-managers are doing, as well as a guide on how to progress to either.  It’s also pointer to the wealth of excellent resources that now exist.</li>\n<li>I last went to <a href=\"https://leaddev.com/\">LeadDev</a> in 2016 and at the time, as a recently-minted tech-lead, I found the content super-stretchy &#x26; valuable.  Several years later, some of the talks feel less relevant but I cannot understate how excellent &#x26; helpful it still was.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leaddev.com/leadingeng-london\">LeadingEng</a> on Friday was exactly the progression it promised to be.  Sitting at a table of directors &#x26; CTOs, there were a few moments where I felt (pleasantly) out of my depth.  I’m definitely writing up some of the things I learned - consider this note public accountability!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At work I’m working on technically enabling different types of product development to occur simultaneously around the same audience &#x26; family of products.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In product teams, our main priority is building &#x26; supporting the right things for our customers.  So the primary challenge is in ensuring that our priorities don’t conflict: <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/20bf537b-e7c7-45f5-be35-35f3e1b2b586\">Last year</a> I optimised for autonomy, by guiding my team to build independent products.  That got us <em>somewhere</em>.</li>\n<li>However that results in an incoherent experience &#x26; lots of duplication - So, now I’m doing research to explore if there is another way: Both technical-archeology around what already exists &#x26; re-reading material like <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies\">Team Topologies</a>.  (It’s an excellent book &#x26; I <em>highly</em> recommend it)</li>\n<li>Reflecting on earlier experiences - When there’s overlap &#x26; unclear ownership, as the primary gatekeepers, engineers end up performing tasks like stakeholder-management (and technical support) which is a conflict in priorities.  Speaking to some of my peers, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source\">inner-sourcing</a> has been suggested — but with engineers still acting as gatekeepers, it doesn't seem like an answer.  If you’ve got views on this topic, I’d love to chat!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all of that in-person interaction and I wanted to avoid making any major plans, so over the weekend I’ve been going through my todo list and fixing the odd issue on this site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The feed’s links <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/pull/2105\">have been broken for quite some time</a>, so today I fixed that.  It may interfere with your feed reader and so if you’re seeing a bunch of new updates - sorry!  That should be the last of the <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/pull/2107\">breaking changes</a>.</li>\n<li>Slight redesign of article pages (this one!), replacing some of the hackier bits: Hopefully things are a bit cleaner now.</li>\n<li>The combination of (popular front-end library) React &#x26; (semi-popular static site generator) is genuinely super fiddly, and I spent far too long fixing its dependencies.  Replacing that is still top-of-mind, expect to hear a bit more about that over the coming months!</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"During the week I was lucky enough to go to both LeadDev & LeadingEng conferences.
