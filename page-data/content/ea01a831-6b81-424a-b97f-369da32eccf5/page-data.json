But long-distance travel â€” which can span <em>days</em> â€” are a <em>lot</em> fuzzier.  These journeys can form their own chapters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week in data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leon wraps consumed: 0</li>\n<li>Hours slept: Not enough. :(</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In my case, a chapter involving some extremely pointy elbows  and my rib-cage on the the first long leg of my journey back: Being allocated a middle-seat is the opposite of winning the lottery.  And it involved some <em>extremely</em> tasty soup (at the pop-up Tin Kee) in Hong-Kong airport which almost made up for everything else...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Long-haul flights get the travel out of the way, but, after youâ€™ve done one or two (ever) they arenâ€™t exactly exciting. You learn rules, tricks, optimisations to make the lost time  easier to manage.  You begin to trade these with your fellow travellers: This route has better food, this seat is easier to sleep in, this airline is much cheaper, this airport is to be avoided at all costs.  Long-haul travel becomes a part of the identity - and not one I enjoy embracing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Anyway, more importantly, my local Lawson is closed for refurbishment - I hope they finally fix their coffee machines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Back to work, and head-first into a little bit of framework investigation.  Going straight in after returning was a bit ambitious because the jet-lag is not being kind to me this time around and I canâ€™t stop yawning.  I even did my ritual park visit and everything to no avail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>First language class on Thursday. Went well. Jumped directly into hiragana which I had not expected to be <em>writing</em>. Need more practice!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mt Fuji made an appearance through the office window, which was a welcome surprise!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Checked luggage and baggage carousels are pretty good and reliable these days, moreso with tech like air tags, so I donâ€™t understand why folks do carry-on luggage and make embarkation/disembarkation a real chore for everyone else.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Health markers going the right direction. ðŸ¤ž</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Walking around at the weekend I randomly stumbled upon an outdoors concert and - gosh - firstly Iâ€™m impressed at how energetic the performers were considering their state of dress and how utterly bitterly cold it is right now - and secondly - maybe itâ€™s a stylistic choice but it really didnâ€™t sound in tune...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And I spent a decent chunk of the rest of the weekend doing viewings. Iâ€™m pretty set on the area I want, but, Iâ€™m not set on any of the places Iâ€™ve seen yet.  Maybe next week will yield better results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Watched a few movies on the plane back but I donâ€™t have enough space to review them properly, so here goes: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0172493\">Girl, Interrupted (1999)</a>: pretty good, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23793170\">Coup!
