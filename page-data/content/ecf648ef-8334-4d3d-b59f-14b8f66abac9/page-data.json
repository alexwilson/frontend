This week I spent a lot of time at home waiting for deliveries, assembling furniture and preparing recycling materials from all the packaging.  More of it was that last one than I’m proud to admit.</li>\n<li>New monitor &#x26; desk means I can now work from home.  Actually, this time.</li>\n<li>This week I founded a new team which will be accountable for technical architecture.  On top of wrap-up activities for my previous area, I did requirement-gathering with my new stakeholders and I began developing a 3-pillar strategy.  Next step is writing a charter and drafting objectives - exciting stuff.</li>\n<li>Naturally I’m re-reading “<a href=\"https://gilest.org/books/ach.html\">The Agile Comms Handbook</a>” one of the most useful business books of all time.</li>\n<li>Went to the taco placed that must not be named.</li>\n<li>On Friday there was a major Cloudflare incident. You’ve probably heard about it.  This blog was unaffected, I’m not sure why.</li>\n<li>Wrote a 3000-word blog post this week, but missed my deadline after this incident took my tools offline.

Absolutely solid: 3.5/5.</li>\n<li>I’m now the proud owner of an olive tree.  It’s very small and I’m nervous about its upkeep.  I haven’t owned an actual plant in a long time.</li>\n<li>Inaugurating all my new furniture, I started playing <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-mario-galaxy--3\">Mario Galaxy</a> for the first time ever and I’m actually really enjoying it?</li>\n<li>No blog this week?
