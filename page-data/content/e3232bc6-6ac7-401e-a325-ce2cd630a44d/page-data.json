Unfortunately not in time for me to have potentially bungled something.</li>\n<li>At work I held a kick-off meeting which went OK, although my facilitation skills feel very rusty.  Gotta re-sharpen them.</li>\n<li>Built an “AI Agent”. Can honestly say I’ve worked on nothing quite like this before - and the results are good - although integrating it into workflows is proving challenging: Sometimes I miss Bertha.</li>\n<li>Had my second annual health check this week. It ran smoothly albeit long even if the phlebotomy left me feeling woozy.</li>\n<li>Friday the Yotsuya lxds drank orange wine and practiced zen buddhism.  I spelt my name right this time.</li>\n<li>Went to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DPc7v_wiZje/\">“Ephemeral” at Such As</a> which was a hybrid data-visualisation &#x26; art installation.  It charted bloom dates in Japan, and shows how changing climate has been shifting them.  Very impressive work and I’m sad it was only open for a weekend because more people should see it.</li>\n<li>Hung out at the Indonesia festival in Yoyogi where I ate an amazing rendang which was the perfect level of spice, and witnessed a killer DJ set on CDJs from 2006.</li>\n<li>Went to see the <a href=\"https://www.mori.art.museum/jp/exhibitions/soufujimoto/index.html\">Sou Fujimoto</a> installation at the Mori Art Museum which was impressive. Hadn’t been to many architecture exhibitions before.  Preferred the actual buildings over the concepts which felt a bit impractical.  It included a scaled replica of the Grand Ring from the Osaka Expo, complete with a queue to enter it.</li>\n<li>Arisugawa-no-miya is full of beauty this time of the year.  I can’t wait for the 28th when we cross into Autumn proper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/img_4790-collage_original.jpeg\" alt=\"Collage of week 42, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 42, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"What a week, huh?
