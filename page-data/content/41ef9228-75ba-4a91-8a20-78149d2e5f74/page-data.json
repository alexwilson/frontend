Hope it’s nothing.</li>\n<li>Went to the <a href=\"http://www.asagaya.or.jp/tanabata/tanabata.html\">Asagaya Tanabata festival</a> at the weekend which was hella crowded but was lined with good food.

Mostly prompted by having recovered from travelling enough to settle into a routine, recent glimpses of three lives — the past, future and present — and the juxtaposition between them have weighed heavy.  But I’m over it now.  Time spent in reflection, and more time spent chatting to two friends really helped.</li>\n<li>Attribution matters.
