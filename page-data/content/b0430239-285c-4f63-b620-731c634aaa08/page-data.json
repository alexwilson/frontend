Goodbye Shibaura and hello Azabu.  It’s a considerably different experience: Some streets round here don't feel like Tokyo.  And amongst other things, I traded a work desk for a dining table.  I haven’t had a dining table since August 2021.  Now my breakfasts feel somehow dignified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week in data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Papers read: 0</li>\n<li>Distance run: 10.82km</li>\n<li>Gigs attended: 0</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class is going well.  We formally began the Kanji.  At some point I have learned to handwrite most of the katakana and hiragana.  And at Tuesday lunchtime I managed to order in a non-English-speaking restaurant without any aids, and it didn’t <em>seem</em> very awkward.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second month in a row that I’m deep-cleaning a flat.  This one was a bit easier at least: Three months is a lot less than four years.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MA helped me move by renting a van and helping me shift 3 bags, 2 suitcases and 1 box all in one go.  This was by far the easiest inter-city move I’ve ever done — the hard part was sourcing the bags — and I hope the next one goes just as smoothly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Micro-milestone: Figured out how to do bank transfers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I’m running again.  Sort-of.  It’s an experiment.  I’m doing <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/13660802366\"><em>very</em> basic training</a>.  After <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/97c9a70f-3d45-4d96-94dd-3071f6af2dcd\">The Scary Health Condition</a>, other than hikes, I avoided exercise because <em>frankly</em> at first I was terrified and anxious.  Instead of confronting that fear I avoided it, allowing it compound with other anxieties, until the interest payments morphed into unhealthy coping strategies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And we said goodbye to that last year.  Also, I got a clean bill of health, <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/63f289ce-7de8-4213-b340-2bd83d302a0d\">twice</a>.  Towards this year’s Theme, and continuing this not-so-new health century, this is me, Alex, confronting it.  The slow, gentle, data-driven way.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What I have learned so far, is, that, traffic lights are out to get you.  Or, at least, they are out to ruin your pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pigeons can be kind-of aggressive, huh.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>So <em>anyway</em>, there I was, strapped to a table alone in a basement with my trousers down.  No, no, in the hospital- remember I mentioned that that thing with my arm?  Ack it’s a long story.  You really had to be there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092048/\">Tampopo (1985)</a> <em>the</em> “ramen western” - with subtitles, and what a delight that was.  Beautiful cinematography.  Solid bits.  And a young Ken Watanabe.
