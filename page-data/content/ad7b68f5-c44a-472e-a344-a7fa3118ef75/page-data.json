I did manage to sign-off on the architecture for a new product, but, didn’t get that far with a threat-modelling exercise.</li>\n<li>My previous boss, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rikstill\">Rik Still</a> left the FT on Thursday.  Preparing a leaving front-page &#x26; card was one thing, saying “tara for now” was another. Held it together pretty well, I think.  The several years working together have been some of my most impactful &#x26; you’ve had my back at every turn, thanks Rik.</li>\n<li>Commuting every day this week was a wonder for getting more casual reading in.  It came at the expense of “spare time”, but this week I’m grateful to have had the time to finish reading “<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43835469-the-ungrateful-refugee\">The Ungrateful Refugee</a>”.

It’s cut, folded &#x26; inserted further down the line - while the ink is drying.</li>\n<li>The edition was finalised &#x26; ready for print (aka <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_stone\">off-stone</a>) at around 8PM.  Aluminium plates were etched in massive machines, expertly mounted onto offset rollers and gradually several-stories of heavy press machinery started turning.</li>\n<li>One small snafu (a tear!) and many quality samples later (as the control room optimised quality) — the press sped-up quickly to blink-and-you’ll-miss-it speeds — and out popped pristine newspapers.  Cold-set printing is cold, and after picking up a copy my fingers were covered in ink.  “Hot off the press”?  Myth busted.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Brighter, warmer weather this week has been a blessing after hunkering down inside for finals last week.
