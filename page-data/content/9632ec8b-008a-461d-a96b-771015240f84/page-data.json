Well done reader, I know it was hard, and I’m proud of you.</p>\n<p>This week was split between Nagoya and Tokyo.</p>\n<p>What did we learn this week? 🤔</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly: Don’t share a tatami room with someone who is sick. I had a sniffly nose for the duration.</li>\n<li>Secondly: KFC is kinda bland, and even if you’re able to pick the fabled <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/whats-the-deal-with-kfc-and-christmas-in-japan\">“Party Barrel”</a> up last minute, it really isn’t worth your while.  I was right to dodge it <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/c363c1fb-8348-4502-8a65-3ed904f858e4/\">last year</a>.</li>\n<li>Thirdly: Karaoke snack bars are <em>the</em> place to be, and you absolutely must make friends with the hostess.  Meanwhile karaoke open bars are more of a gamble, and making friends here is optional.</li>\n<li>Fourthly: Quite a lot about how to architect a workflow engine, and how approval flows work in Japanese companies.</li>\n<li>Finally: <a href=\"https://www.bucyocoffee.com/\">Bucyo Coffee</a> do the best <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B9\">モーニング</a> in Nagoya, and you’d better play by the Bucyo’s rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What else went on? 🤔</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invented a cocktail that RM would approve of, but it would horrify AG. Sorry lxds.</li>\n<li>Some <em>very</em> good 1:1s this week.</li>\n<li>My objectives/expectations for next year now include me learning to sing Candy Tune’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HKbo1FstOE\">Fight</a>.  When I agreed to this, it didn't seem to have many words.  Is this what regret feels like?</li>\n<li>I really enjoyed working from the Nagoya branch office for a few days, since it's pretty small. I haven't worked in such an intimate environment since the early days of the Specialist in Sofia, and I forgot how nice an experience it it is when the <em>entire office</em> heads out to lunch.</li>\n<li>There's pretty good hot chocolate there too, or so I'm told.</li>\n<li>On Christmas day, I worked from home, and as background noise put on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Lessons_and_Carols\">nine lessons &#x26; carols</a> from a variety of British minsters and cathedrals. It helped a bit with setting a festive atmosphere. If you’re noticing that this is a mere bullet-point in my notes, that’s <em>kiiiiind-of</em> what celebrating Christmas in Japan is like?</li>\n<li>Fusion speedrun ended badly. sob sob.</li>\n<li>Texted nearly my entire address book with semi-personalised Christmas messages, and nearly everybody replied, which also helped with the atmosphere.</li>\n<li>Closed the work-year at sake club where I learned a few new words and made some new friends.</li>\n<li>Closed the <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/4a8d9445-0103-4a8d-a6be-f2db18dbb678\">busy era</a>, or at least, tried to, my todo list is still quite long.</li>\n<li>And, closing these notes, as I introspect on the most change, people and distance I have ever experienced in a single calendar year, I keep coming back to the same few intrusive thoughts.</li>\n<li>Don’t worry, I’ve learned from my mistakes this year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w52-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 52, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 52, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Phew, we did it, we made it to another Christmas in Japan.
