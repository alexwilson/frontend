Picked up a left-field assignment that had me running around the building to speak to different departments, skimming research papers and writing a Jupyter notebook - all with a slightly stressful deadline that I barely hit - genuinely energising in a good way.</li>\n<li>Had a follow-up occupational health appointment and pleasantly realised that while I'm not where I was health-wise at the close of last year, I'm much closer than I was.  Alas, my wait on the NHS continues.</li>\n<li>Sometimes visibly doing <em>anything</em> is more important than invisibly doing <em>the right thing</em>.</li>\n<li><em>(And sometimes a comment in Alex's week-notes is a comment in Alex's week-notes!  Nothing to decode here, at least not this time)</em></li>\n<li>Also learned why stroke order is important in kana.  Turns out that シ &#x26; ツ and ン &#x26; ソ are imminently readable once you've learned how to write them out and can see the patterns.  (This font makes it easier!)</li>\n<li>This week's <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19712484/\">Ted Lasso</a> was fantastic.</li>\n<li>Spent the weekend in York for a stag-do involving many bars and a boat which didn't collide with a bridge.  We all stayed in the second-tallest building in York.</li>\n<li>Late in the evening we watched Eurovision at <a href=\"https://brewyork.co.uk/\">Brew York</a>.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGuGfdEJ5Pw\">Croatia's entry</a> was clever: lots of winning elements but with heaps of personality and satire mixed in - it's rare to see shit-posts that well formed.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6rS8Dv5g-8\">My fave entry was from Finland</a> and it was was a flat-out <strong>banger</strong>, incorporating elements of techno and metal because why not.  Entire bar sang along.  Disappointing that the jury then overrode the popular vote.</li>\n<li>Had my first Yorkshire pudding in Yorkshire today.  Although I heard up north that they're just called puddings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w19.jpg\" alt=\"Week 19, 2023.\"></p>","excerpt":"Short week, but I packed in tonnes, too much to write about really: We kicked off the thing I mentioned last week (although I haven't done…"},"slug":"/content/b42894a1-eec7-4459-a4b5-70e13408d9d8","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":[]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"b42894a1-eec7-4459-a4b5-70e13408d9d8"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
