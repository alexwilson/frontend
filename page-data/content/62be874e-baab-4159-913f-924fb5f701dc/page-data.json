Had a real blast at both seeing and chatting with people who I don’t normally get the chance to.</li>\n<li>During rounders we incepted everybody to skip going to the normal pub in favour of one far more accessible and public transport friendly. Despite a brazen bag theft, it went well.</li>\n<li>Dealt with an outage where, even after restoring service, labelling the exact root cause proved tricky: It was compounded and began in a different part of the organisation. How it spread was the interesting factor, and I’m really looking forward to the retrospective.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sanshinkai.uk/okinawa-day/\">Okinawa day</a> was the closest thing I’ve seen to a Japanese festival in London. Lots of elated folk singing/dancing and a solid selection of snacks from the area.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14914430/\">Unfrosted</a> was pretty damn funny. That Seinfeld guy could be a star.</li>\n<li>Doctor Who season finale was <em>good</em>, but, felt rushed? Lots of things happened quickly, and they <a href=\"https://x.com/jblacksomething/status/1804526773964575025\">didn’t all add up</a>. I’m still hooked — but I feel like I did after Prometheus.</li>\n<li>Spent much of Sunday pouring over some outstanding admin for my degree (including sending a flurry of emails) and successfully planned how to complete the whole thing. Assuming all goes well, I should be selecting a specialism before the end of this year. (If you can guess it, you get a prize!)</li>\n<li>Finally let my 150 day Duolingo streak end: It’s fun, but it takes up a lot of time. Streaks bum me out — missing a day in BeReal was heartbreaking — and they don’t motivate me well enough.</li>\n<li>またね!</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"This week was marked by the duality of my team’s quarterly planning day and my department’s yearly rounders outing.
