A few <code class=\"language-text\">transpose</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">table</code>s later and now you’re cooking. <em>(without a spreadsheet!)</em></li>\n<li>With not much I could actually do, I picked <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom\">Tears of the Kingdom</a> back up after <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/2815bfca-621e-4c87-b237-4e19a87e5a47\">unlocking all the Lightroots last year</a> and beat all 120 shrines, all 32 sky shrines and a bunch of side-quests.</li>\n<li>Continuing the streak, I booted up <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild\">Breath of the Wild</a> for the first time since 2017 and completed all 120 shrines there too and some of the EX shrines.  At some point the game design started to feel so tedious that my inner completionist took over and now here we are.</li>\n<li>To keep my distance from the screens, I finally split the Switch's joycons. It's a really liberating play-style and I now really wish <em>all</em> controllers were like this, and that there were any keyboards/mice available which work the same way.</li>\n<li>Watched a fair number of films and TV too: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13210838\">The Gentlemen (2024)</a> was fun but like many other streaming-first shows it felt a tad too artificial. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2883512\">Chef (2014)</a> was spectacular: A lovely film, I wholeheartedly recommend for any audience.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rtain.jp/\">RTA in Japan</a> is happening right now and so far has proven far more wholesome than Defcon this year.</li>\n<li>And now with my energy levels and my sense of smell slowly returning to normal, it’s time to get back in the grind eh?</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Not much happened this past fortnight.
