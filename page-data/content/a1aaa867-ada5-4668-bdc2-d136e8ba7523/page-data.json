Not only were we joined by a new member, but I think we hit a record number of “Aha” moments.  The paper we're reading has some fairly complicated but crucial maths.  The difference was applying the advice of my high-school maths teacher PJ to the equations in the paper, “When in doubt, try it out, with easy numbers”.  So, e.g., a vector of size 2, and a layer of size 3, that sort of thing.
