There were some updates I wanted to talk about and I debated posting anything at all, but I’m both Ukrainian &#x26; Russian by blood and so cannot be entirely silent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>History and culture are products of real-world, lived experience.  One doesn’t normally become an expert on <em>other</em> occupations and conflicts by reading the odd article, and - this is no exception.</li>\n<li>Especially right now you <em>must</em> pay caution to what you read, watch and think.  <a href=\"https://bookdown.org/rlridenour/ct-text/\">Be deeply skeptical</a>, especially of short/punchy views.
