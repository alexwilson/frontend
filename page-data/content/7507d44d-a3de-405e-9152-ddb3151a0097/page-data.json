(the 2019 record is <em>probably</em> impossible to beat though).</li>\n<li>The JS community said it couldn’t be done, but in a tiny technical win, I figured out how to feature-flag something gnarly this week. (<em><a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/97c9a70f-3d45-4d96-94dd-3071f6af2dcd\">Maybe still technical?</a></em>).</li>\n<li>Marking <em>roughly</em> a year since it started, Papers Club finished our longest paper yet, completing our deep-dive into Mixture of Experts architecture.  In our year we’ve welcomed guests, new members and new structure and I’ve learned lots.</li>\n<li>Move over <a href=\"https://jisho.org/word/%E5%BE%AE%E5%A6%99\">微妙</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://jisho.org/word/%E6%88%90%E7%A8%8B\">成る程</a>, my new favourite word is <a href=\"https://jisho.org/word/%E7%A2%BA%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AB\">確かに</a> and it’s ENDLESSLY applicable.</li>\n<li>Have resumed running <em>outside</em> of the gym, and so <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/14792322238/overview\">attempted Palace Run again</a>.  Last time I ran it was in 2018, but despite coming back after several years, this attempt saw a better finishing time with both better pace &#x26; recovery.  Lots of room for improvement but this is my first “long run” in years and I’m still here!  Quite happy.</li>\n<li>Two glasses of wine let me say some silly things, whilst regrettably, not saying some other things.  But in a good way this time.  In vino veritas, eh.</li>\n<li>and in LB’s old yard of all places.</li>\n<li>Completed more steps of The Internet Saga. They sent me a letter! Conclusion hopefully soon!</li>\n<li>Since it’s all available on YouTube, I’ve been watching the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23319074\">Horne Section</a> show over breakfast all week.  It’s been quite nice to enjoy a slice of British TV comedy (since, unfortunately most of it is paywalled outside of the UK!).</li>\n<li>OH: “What’s the opposite of a bar-raiser?”</li>\n<li>Rediscovered my notes from that stand-up course last summer.  Reader, the temptation is <em>real</em>. Somebody <em>stop</em> me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w24-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 24, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 24, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"What to say.
