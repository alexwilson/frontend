As well as speaking to some people — including former-colleagues — about their\nexperiences with me over the years, I wanted something more regimented that I could compare against in the future.</p>\n<p>Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/johari-window.html\">Anna Shipman's excellent post</a> on using a Johari\nwindow to understand her strengths, I decided to try doing the same thing.  Against her advice, I decided to use a\nGoogle form because I wanted to \"own\" my data.</p>\n<p>On reflection it's entirely possible that this has biased my results, as it presents the options in a very linear\nformat!  Nonetheless I found a <a href=\"https://kevan.org/johari\">very nice tool by Kevan</a> which I recommend for future\nexercises.</p>\n<h2>What was my process?</h2>\n<p>I sent out the survey via Slack to 8 random colleagues — whom I'd worked with at some point over my 5½ years — hoping\nto try and get as fair an assessment as possible.  I'm quite confident that this was the best way of going about it, as\nonly asking named individuals within a single team or two would have likely given feedback biased on factors unrelated\nto my personality (such as perceived performance, which tends to be rather similar within a given team).</p>\n<p>Of that 8, I received 5 (mostly) anonymous responses.  Then (without peeking!) I selected the six adjectives which I\nfelt best fit my personality from my own perspective, and after mapping, ended up with the following window.</p>\n<h2>Results and takeaways</h2>\n<p><img src=\"/pictures/20190414--johari-window.png\" alt=\"Johari window results\" title=\"Johari widow results\"></p>\n<p>On the one-hand, these results are remarkably good! There's a trend towards more stoic personality traits which\nreflect my core values and I hope have made a net-positive impression on people I've worked with.\n<em>For now at least, this works wonders for my imposter syndrome.</em></p>\n<p>On the other hand, two other values I felt like I had carefully internalised — Empathy and Helpfulness — did not come\nup at all. It's possible that some of the ambiguity in the traits which <em>were</em> identified alluded to the same thing,\nhowever instead of dwelling on possibilities, I think that this simply marks an opportunity to better direct future\nrequests for feedback from the people I work with.  Then comparing future results against these in a few years time\nperhaps I will come across a bit better.  Or perhaps I will have changed tact completely?</p>\n<p>Overall the Johari window process has been hugely motivating and has shown me where and how I can continue to develop.\nIt's remarkable how much power a feedback process which <em>entirely</em> excludes negativity can have, for personal growth!</p>\n<p>I am glad to have gone through this exercise and strongly recommend you, dear reader, do the same.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Raw data</h2>\n<p>My selection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calm</li>\n<li>Empathetic</li>\n<li>Energetic</li>\n<li>Helpful</li>\n<li>Knowledgeable</li>\n<li>Observant</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Survey results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>able (2)</li>\n<li>adaptable (1)</li>\n<li>calm (1)</li>\n<li>clever (2)</li>\n<li>complex (1)</li>\n<li>confident (2)</li>\n<li>energetic (1)</li>\n<li>friendly (1)</li>\n<li>independent (2)</li>\n<li>intelligent (2)</li>\n<li>knowledgeable (4)</li>\n<li>logical (1)</li>\n<li>observant (1)</li>\n<li>organized (1)</li>\n<li>patient (1)</li>\n<li>powerful (1)</li>\n<li>reflective (1)</li>\n<li>sensible (1)</li>\n<li>trustworthy (1)</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"After getting a decent amount of positive, useful feedback while going through a number of recruitment processes, I was\nkeen to take the…","frontmatter":{"title":"Taking a look through a Johari window","tags":["personal-development","career","stoicism","bluetel"],"date":"2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","last_modified_at":null,"author":"alex","image_credit":null},"fields":{"formattedDate":"Sunday, April 14th, 2019","image":null,"date":"2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/content/cdf6575f-d01f-43bb-8a26-eb1530ca9952","_legacy_slug":"/blog/2019/04/14/taking-a-look-through-a-johari-window/"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/content/cdf6575f-d01f-43bb-8a26-eb1530ca9952","_legacy_slug":"/blog/2019/04/14/taking-a-look-through-a-johari-window/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2203825502","63159454"]}
