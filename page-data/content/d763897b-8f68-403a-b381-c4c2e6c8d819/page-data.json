She had a point-of-view set-up reminiscent of some of my favourite YouTubers, but, much unlike them she had designed something that was much more beginner-friendly - including a smaller rack with fewer modules &#x26; colour-coded patch cables, all very nice touches. The slow campaign to persuade more people over to techno, synthesis and production is making steady progress - congrats Kara!</li>\n<li>There was also a quiz which was definitely rigged.  Or, er, at least I lost.</li>\n<li>I gave a new talk titled “The Magic Button”, reflecting on a difficult time several years ago where my team made some mistakes, what we did about them &#x26; what we learned.</li>\n<li>The final-polish sprint running up to my slot was “fun” as always. I went through all five stages of preparing a talk: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Melodramatic Nervousness and Deliverance. Right before taking the stage, for a second, I actually froze up. Apparently nobody noticed it, but in that moment I felt eternity: That's a first.</li>\n<li>It's difficult talking openly about difficult times: In the industry there's usually so much success spin in talks where we filter-out or redress our (inevitable!) mistakes. I hope at least one person walked away hearing that it's okay to make large mistakes — what's more important is how we respond to them. With some pacing adjustments, I might try to deliver this to external audiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we approach the end of the year, time feels like it has really sped up!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The days are getting shorter - working from home it's now a little harder to catch the sunlight. Not ideal.</li>\n<li>There's a lot I need to get done both at home &#x26; at work over the next few weeks. In giving a talk I seriously worried that I'd overcommitted — so I'm glad I followed through with it, but, the remaining major tasks for the rest of the year are all a little less optional. Please wish me luck.</li>\n<li>Relatedly, without reflecting on omnicron &#x26; the wave of anxiety it's summoned back up, I am suddenly regretting not renewing my passport sooner.</li>\n<li>This weekend, for the first time ever, I've been watching the <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/article/view/world-chess-championship-2021\">FIDE World Championship</a>. It's definitely a different pace to other sporting events I've followed — none of the mayhem of <a href=\"https://npb.jp/eng/\">NPB</a> or the energy of <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/\">FIFA</a> — but the same palpable tension. These chess games are a bit slower yet very deliberate and both the official &#x26; <a href=\"http://chess.com\">chess.com</a> commentaries have helped me really understand what is going on. Somehow it feels like the right level of energy after this week &#x26; something I hope to continue following for years to come.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"This week saw the 2021 edition of the FT's internal conference, EngineRoom...
