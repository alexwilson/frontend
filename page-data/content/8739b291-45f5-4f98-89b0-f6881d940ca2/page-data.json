I built a new tool for idempotently managing DNS records within a zone, and have hooked it into the same CI process which manages and distributes server configurations, meaning that now DNS is completely democratised. <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/blog/2018/11/10/democratising-and-automating-dns/\">I’ve written up some of the reasoning and methodology here</a>.</li>\n<li>In actually building this thing there was the opportunity to start using Golang 1.11 modules which turn out to be seamless, hassle-free and actually incredibly awesome if also poorly documented. Really fantastic that there’s so much investment of time and effort into improving Golang’s developer experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reflections</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>This week I have been reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0141033576\">Thinking: Fast and Slow</a> and it provides a great model for examining interactions. Aside from prompting me to reexamine many concepts and conversations which I have taken as \"just so\", because I may have avoided exerting the effort to check their logical consistency, I have lately become so easily distractible that I have forgotten the joy and value of reading. As a theme for coming weeks, I will be paying more attention to my energy levels and to trying to introduce unitasking.</li>\n<li>This week has also been pretty rough. Maybe it’s related to the clocks going back and is an early indication of SAD but motivation feels harder. On the upside, <a href=\"gyrosco.pe\">Gyrosco.pe</a> have updated their mood tracking and have (apparently) added a feature to nag mood check-ins, so hopefully I’ll be able to get some useful data out of it.</li>\n<li>It was my mother’s birthday this week and together with my sister we out for dinner to celebrate. It’s kind-of surreal how different the dynamic is now that we’re all a group of adults, leading entirely and completely different lives. I suppose it’s not that big a deal since every other family will have gone through this same transition at some stage, but it’s quite remarkable to have gone through it.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Loads of good conferences on this week: In no particular order, <em>Sharp intake of breath</em>. FFConf, PerfNow, WebPerfDays Amsterdam, muConf, SeaGL, DACHFest and P3X. Seems like by far this was this busiest conf week all year! Wish I could’ve gone to most of these because they all sounded awesome: Oh well, at least I got to play with a JamBoard.</li>\n<li>Holy carp there’s a lot of hype going on right now about React Hooks. Haven’t had a chance to look yet, but going by <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/387p7vo9z5\">examples like this one, implementing slider interactions</a> we may see much more portable user experience pattern libraries springing up. Also these seem like a good replacement for mixins?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nodegirlslondon/status/1061306448125267974\">The FT hosted NodeGirlsLondon today</a>. Nice work to everybody involved!</li>\n<li>With Black Friday coming up, an interesting tidbit came up during conversation this week: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juokaz/status/1061367299918217217\">Singles Day generated $3B for AliBaba in just a couple of minutes</a>. I can’t help but wonder how much revenue will be generated this season. At peak, $1 million per minute was spent last year. Can we top that?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/03/japanese-island-quietly-disappeared-no-one-noticed-until-now/\">Missing: The island of Esanbehanakitakojima. Have you seen it?</a> In all seriousness, coastal erosion is scary and climate change is making it happen quicker.  And it’s happening—rather quietly—<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45983260\">at an unprecedented rate in the UK</a>. Don’t know about you but I’m not a fantastic swimmer.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"This week has had a strong theme of self-reflection, off of the back of researching and forward-planning for one project, and running a team…"},"slug":"/content/8739b291-45f5-4f98-89b0-f6881d940ca2","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":["/blog/2018/11/10/weeknotes/"]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"8739b291-45f5-4f98-89b0-f6881d940ca2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"]}
