Since they were on the way, we also visited Stonehenge to get yelled at by security &#x26; Oxford to get yelled at by some cyclists.</li>\n<li>Visiting Oxford was really nice. Spending so much time there as a teen, I did a spot tour of the very centre, ending up at the <a href=\"https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/oxfordshire/turf-tavern/\">Turf Tavern</a> where I got to overhear the funniest debate about fishes and metaphysics.  What fish would you be?</li>\n<li>Spent a lot of time at work this week with the interactive publishing stack.  On top of recruiting for a small group to work on advancing it (kicking off soon™), I began documenting and building a dashboard for one of the most misunderstood bits of kit. The dashboard has already unpleasantly surprised me.</li>\n<li>Splunk tip of the week: Build a dashboard by starting with data-sources, and chained searches <em>first</em> before ever trying to do anything with the user interface.  It's faster and less confusing.  And remember to export fields from each parent searches with <code class=\"language-text\">| fields nameOfField1, nameOfField2</code></li>\n<li>Wound up at a pub quiz after being promised wings. A lady read out some numbers which I somehow immediately knew was \"Poseidon\" spelt out on a phone dialling pad.  Need to re-examine my life-choices.  The wings were ok.  We came second.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> is very nice actually,,</li>\n<li>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/efinlay24/\">Euan</a> left again, this time the country, marked by a gathering in Whitechapel.  Lovely to be back in the area and see even more old friends - and feeling nostalgia and regret in moving away - maybe I'll move back someday?  Rushed to catch the last train, accidentally caught a different last train, whoops!</li>\n<li>Apparently friends in CRG read these? If so, hi!</li>\n<li>Saturday was my birthday, and the entire country of England threw a surprise party for me.</li>\n<li>In all seriousness, I attempted to organise something but even weeks away the coronation overshadowed the day.  So I enthusiastically boycotted both and crashed a gathering at the <a href=\"https://www.bermondsey-beer-mile.co.uk/\">Bermondsey Beer Mile</a> instead.  Lost at fußball.  But, like AFC Richmond, at least I tried.</li>\n<li>Trying to write something this weekend, and am once again slightly annoyed at my CMS.  <em>Ugh</em>.  (Weeknotes are now starting in Logseq!).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w18.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 18, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"Bank holiday week this week, marked by a Monday road-trip to Winchester Service Station to watch the cherry blossom.
