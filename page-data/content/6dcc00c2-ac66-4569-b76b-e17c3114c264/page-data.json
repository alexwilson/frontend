The theme was AI and we had just over a day to try and build something interesting.  It was loads of fun!</li>\n<li>My team of EH, AC, OO, FS and I started out by trying to generate video accompaniments to articles - but after realising that the videos were rather long, we pivoted towards video shorts (think: tiktok).  To enable our hack, I wrote a cursed integration between google sheets and our internal LLM.  We managed to create a few videos but it's nowhere near ready for prime-time: we didn't win, but we did get a few laughs and a shout-out from the judges!</li>\n<li>Some teams built some really cool stuff!  Including a novel chat based UI for interacting with the site (one that actually seemed quite fresh) and a Nikkei team built a tool for geolocation for use in investigative journalism.</li>\n<li>Tuesday marked Arjun's birthday and for lack of rain we went on a mission to infiltrate another drinks: In the end we were invited and so the mission failed.</li>\n<li>Continuing the theme of Machine-Learning, I picked <a href=\"https://www.credly.com/badges/0bc35463-7478-4b67-88b3-0060d78feee8\">IBM's AI Engineering certification</a> back up (having paused it in 2020) and finished the whole thing over the weekend.  Lots of repeated content, but also a really nice opportunity to really get to grips with the innards of neural networks.</li>\n<li>Between the ML stuff, at the weekend I hung out with Tanha and we ended up going to <a href=\"http://tokotonramen.com/\">Tokoton ramen</a> which is a solid recommend.  Really good: Owners are from Fukuoka and Osaka respectively, and even though it's not on the menu, they do a mean karamisoramen (辛味噌ラーメン)!</li>\n<li>On a whim I've been watching <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6461726/\">AP Bio</a> recently, and it's great.  Same feel-good vibes as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4477976/\">SuperStore</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w30.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 30, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 30, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"This week marked the FT's first hackday in two years.
