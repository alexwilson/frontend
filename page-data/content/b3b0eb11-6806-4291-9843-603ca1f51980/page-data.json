Immensely satisfying.

Real 2017 vibes.</li>\n<li>Went hiking with Z, C, J, M &#x26; P along the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters,_Sussex\">Seven Sisters</a> and their secret unacknowledged eighth sister.  We nearly ended up at Brighton but were distracted by a very average Sunday roast.
