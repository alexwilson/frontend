Slightly hotter than those in Germany and without any Aufguss – which I’ve realised are my favourite part — but it still slaps and for a day after my skin felt incredible.</li>\n<li>On Friday, I tagged along with Joel to see <a href=\"https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~lac/Comedy/CarrCrash/\">Carr Crash</a> in the Vault bar at Kings. Leslie and Ruby were hilarious and high energy, genuinely a pleasure to experience. And academic hecklers are an <em>experience</em>. Got lost trying to leave after: Bush House is a maze! <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/ruby-carr-ebae\">Go watch Ruby talk about eBay at the fringe</a>!</li>\n<li>Recently started a co-op campaign of Borderlands 3 with L. I have a real love-hate relationship with the series, because each instalment since after the first game feels like the writing and gameplay design are trying far too hard. That being said, the everything about <a href=\"https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Lectra_City\">Lectra City</a> was hilarious and we couldn’t stop laughing.</li>\n<li>After a few cancellations, poker night devolved into a mini-pub-crawl and a meal at <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/adc14gErCogMkCso6\">Yalla Beirut</a>, which I was not-so-secretly thrilled about because it’s one of my favourite unknown spots in the city. Amazing falafel.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13649112/\">Baby Reindeer</a> was at many points quite unsettling and difficult to watch. Would I recommend it? Not sure. Raw storytelling. Difficult subjects including SA. Not for everyone.</li>\n<li>Capping the week <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/2024-05-26-set\">I played a hard techno set</a> — the fastest BPM and heaviest selection I’ve played in a very long time. My prep was roughly memorising the harmonics and adding a few new bangers to my USBs. It went OK I thought. Going faster means mistakes are more obvious, but there’s more opportunity to recover.</li>\n<li>Having nothing but trouble with this blog at the moment: Every week or so I have a new exciting problem halting publishing (Gatsby-related dependency problems breaking builds), and my email provider is inconsistent. Very close to migrating to Wordpress at this point. It’s just not fun fixing it every weekend, especially with weather this nice.</li>\n<li>Bring on June.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"New UK General Election just dropped: It heralds a slightly busier (and  dare I say exciting?!) period at work, and my priorities have…"},"slug":"/content/c2e7175d-a995-4dba-8574-539ef62c3fcd","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":[]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"c2e7175d-a995-4dba-8574-539ef62c3fcd"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
