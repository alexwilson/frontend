This week felt <em>particularly</em> long, but I don’t have all that much to say.</li>\n<li>Experimentally I deleted all my social media apps, except for Instagram.  I’d already lowered engagement so this isn’t a huge change, but even scrolling passively was negatively affecting my mood.</li>\n<li>First attempt in years at making pizza from scratch went well.  Better return-on-investment than pizzerias I’ve been to here, but between my dough not being <em>quite</em> right and my oven not getting hot enough, there’s lots of variables to tune ~ which is a fun side-project.</li>\n<li>Impromptu nominkai on Tuesday was very, very good.</li>\n<li>What if Bertha, but good?</li>\n<li>One of my accounts was locked, and to fix it I had to send many emails and make one phone-call.  The phone-call involved iOS’s new live-translation feature, and I felt ashamed using it because the translation <em>from</em> English was not very good and didn’t convey any of my feeble attempts at keigo.  Good for emergencies, but I can't do that again.</li>\n<li>I forgot how dangerous drinking with Europeans can be.</li>\n<li>Organised a leaving karaoke sesh which was very good.  My most ambitious solo song was St. Anger, which required me to adopt James Hetfield’s trademark rasp.  Of course I also did Boney M’s Rasputin, which is basically mandatory for me at this point.</li>\n<li>Obanzai is delicious.
