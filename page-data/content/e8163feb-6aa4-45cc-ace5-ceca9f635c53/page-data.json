I’ve been feeling a little under the weather, but I think now slowly on the mend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week in data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual shoes thrown away: 5</li>\n<li>How long it took me to realise the clocks went back: 18 hours</li>\n<li>Total of all payments made in cash: £17</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have glasses now, sort-of.  I can see totally fine without them - but over the years I’ve developed an astigmatism and so they’re really helping with situations with contrasting bright lights.  Still figuring out when to wear them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In very exciting work news, CCC — which I’ve here and <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/46dcc1c2-4791-4410-9065-e63318554381\">there</a> since its kick-off last April — is now finally live, debuted this week by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10489c19-aecc-43e4-947f-bfde497de7b9\">Joanna Kao’s excellent article on AI-assisted accessibility tooling, and how they aren’t what they seem</a>.  It was a monumental effort getting there and the change seems subtle, but is profound: Previously an article with inline functionality like that would not work on the main website or app.  The same is true of most news organisations and so I'm very excited to see where this capability goes!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Working late on Wednesday (although, mostly stumped by R dependencies, so not that productive) turned into me spot-volunteering for Codebar where I packed a few bags and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codebar-london_codebar-11thbirthday-thankyou-activity-7255154230716416000-znTv\">got papped gossiping with JB on LinkedIn</a>. Always a treat chatting to people who want to shift into tech.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Building on success with applying an EQ, after exploring headphone options and seeing a few price-tags, I decided to fully restore my Sennheiser HD700s instead by replacing, cleaning and fixing nearly all the parts.  They look, feel and <em>sound</em> brand new and I’m chuffed at the upgrade for so little money spent.  As a bonus I also swapped the ear-tips on my AirPods Pros out ones made by <a href=\"https://www.complyfoam.com/\">Comply</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then I did the same with a few pairs of old sneakers (throwing a few others out). Part of a sole which hadn’t glued properly led me to trip up and it was <em>incredibly</em> painful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My Mum came to visit on Saturday to help out a bit with my flat and to set up her new phone. There were delays on both her trains - the route to Euston (as well as the station itself) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/29/peter-hendy-ex-network-rail-chair-threatened-firm-engineer-euston-criticism\">is in really dire shape</a>. Weather was OK and <a href=\"https://sendero-coffee.com/\">Sendero</a> was empty. Yasai for dinner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sunday, L and I visited <a href=\"https://www.japanhouselondon.uk/whats-on/looks-delicious-exploring-japans-food-replica-culture/\">“Looks Delicious!”</a> at Japan House and assembled a fake bento box of fake foods. Fave detail: There are a handful of spilled foods hidden in the corners of the exhibit which <em>look</em> realistic. The spilled drink right by the entrance, however, was real.  Hit up Whole Foods for dinner and had the last dregs of their Goan vegetable curry which absolutely slapped.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Since I had a few more hours at home than expected, I managed to watch the entirety of the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6964748/\">Alex Rider TV series</a>.  I read all the books as a kid and was surprised to see an adaptation was out there: It deviated heavily from the books and I see <em>why</em> the writers did that, but ultimately it went - I think - too close to every other bit of streaming-first young adult TV.  3/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ah yes, and in a bit of a feat, I 100%’d <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/dave-the-diver\">Dave the Diver</a> including the recently released Godzilla and Balatro DLCs.  This game is <em>fantastic</em> and I cannot recommend it enough.  If you're still reading and haven't checked it out yet, forget Factorio and Balatro, and please check out Dave the Diver.  It's a love-letter to video-gaming and you have <em>not</em> experienced anything like it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w43-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 43, 2024\" title=\"collage of week 43, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"Low energy start to the week: I had Monday off, and ended up taking part of Tuesday off too.
