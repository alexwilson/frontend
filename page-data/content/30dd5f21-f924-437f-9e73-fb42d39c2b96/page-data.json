For me, a denier of Thursdays, this is a big deal.</li>\n<li>Skipped cooking on Wednesday because, I accidentally took the last train. Whoops!</li>\n<li>Maybe it's less pressure? Maybe it's novelty? Maybe it's a mixture of a healthier attitude: I did admin, formed a chonky proposal &#x26; wrote some code.  And felt great!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Last week my website build was failing, so, I skipped writing any weeknotes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spent some time learning about Japanese sentence structure instead: から can mean \"so\" or \"because\" &#x26; <a href=\"https://cotoacademy.com/say-because-in-japanese-kara-no-de/\">instantly allows creating compound sentences</a>.
