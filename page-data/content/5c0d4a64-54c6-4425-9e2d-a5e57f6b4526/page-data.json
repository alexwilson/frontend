I'll probably change how the RSS feed works or something to celebrate!</li>\n<li>September's scorching weather is brutal.  Much like has happened with the Central line, an entire summer's worth of heat has built-up in my building, meaning that when I get home I'm greeted by warm water from my cold taps and that my portable air conditioner has met its match.  Avg. 29C, Max 34C, Min 26C.</li>\n<li>So: I'm pretty deep in the rabbit-hole of JavaScript bundling formats right now, but it's OK - it's for a good cause: micro-frontends.  One challenge that we will face is interoperability between ES modules and our current chosen polyfill format: SystemJS.  I enjoy these rabbit-holes, but much less than I used to.</li>\n<li>Our internal conference comes up next year, and I've joined the organising committee.  I'm also planning on submitting a talk to cover one of the bits of work I'm currently involved in.  Is this too much?  We'll see.</li>\n<li>I think I now understand the mental models behind <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">SageMaker</a> now, and I'm genuinely appalled at the documentation behind it.  AWS have some pretty sketchy documentation, but never before have I found it to be genuinely wrong or misleading.  When it works, it's magic: You can train beefy workloads in hours, and it costs a maximum of a few dollars.  Inference is also fairly affordable.  Maybe I should write this stuff up?</li>\n<li>I didn't disassemble an old couch and assemble a new couch on Wednesday.  Went to Mercato instead.  Love that place: If you're reading, please help me find more excuses to go to Mercato.</li>\n<li>Managed to dodge not one, but two social commitments on Saturday.  Honestly the heat wiped me out but I feel awful because I was really looking forward to both.</li>\n<li>Holiday is BOOKED: Japan, for about three weeks in late October.  I'm still wincing at the cost, but I think I've managed to make it as price-efficient as possible.</li>\n<li>Plans on Sunday fell through, so I ended up doing a bit more work on my C++ final, on the DJ app which I'll probably rewrite as a serious project after the final is submitted.  I've implemented rudimentary playlist support, including waveform displays (which are one of my favourite features from <a href=\"https://rekordbox.com/\">Rekordbox</a>) which I'm particularly happy with because - with it already relying on caching, it means that music is pre-analysed before you play a track.  Cool!</li>\n<li>My new kinda-sorta side-project is this cursed thing: the <a href=\"https://beepy.sqfmi.com/\">Beepy</a>.  I got a 3D case printed, painstakingly tracked down the right screws (I now know how metric screw specifications work) and got all the software running.  It's very cute, but I don't have any real use for it: Maybe it'll make for a neat portable Metasploit platform?</li>\n<li>Watched a few movies this week, including <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592/\">Tenet</a>: Interesting idea, great sound-track and definitely a bit of a thinker.  But honestly, all round refreshing to see a science-fiction concept like this be fleshed out and executed in such a short run-time.  Also appreciated the quick reference to Oppenheimer: Starting to see where Nolan got the idea from.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w36.jpg\" alt=\"collage of week 36, 2023\" title=\"collage of week 36, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"Highlights this week include watching the outcomes of a design-sprint, validating the core technical idea in my new project and watching…"},"slug":"/content/5c0d4a64-54c6-4425-9e2d-a5e57f6b4526"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"5c0d4a64-54c6-4425-9e2d-a5e57f6b4526"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","955950066"],"slicesMap":{}}
