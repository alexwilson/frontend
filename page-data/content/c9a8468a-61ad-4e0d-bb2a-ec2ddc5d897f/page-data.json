My week is evenly split into three: Pre-Election, Election Night and Recovery.</li>\n<li>Pre-election my focus at work was end-to-end testing a few scenarios that were <em>theoretically</em> fine, but had not been tested. I’m super glad we did this because we identified a few bottlenecks that would have been tricky to diagnose in a worst-case scenario.</li>\n<li>Had the first of several executive-coaching sessions this week to discuss things including how to improve my adaptability: First step is doing a personality assessment which will help me identify my innate behaviours versus my learned behaviours.</li>\n<li>The night of the election was fantastic: I was doing the 10PM-4AM shift, so shifted my sleep schedule slightly in the days before. On Thursday I woke up at midday, went to my polling station and went to a sauna session in Bermondsey before arriving at the office around 4:30PM via Rosslyn.</li>\n<li>Our systems ran stable (if a little hot) so things were mostly quiet on the night - So I focussed on supporting my on-shift colleagues and was drafted into a few small issues with interactive/live content.  Left around 6:30AM in pretty high spirits having handed over to people working day-time.  Truthfully so much stuff happened that it's impossible to recount, but it may be one of the evenings I've ever had.</li>\n<li>The energy in the newsroom was phenomenal: It was crowded at 10PM when the exit polls were announced, and there were cheers over the night as certain seats were won or lost.</li>\n<li>The night in numbers: 1 flat white, 2 teas and 1.5 bottles of club mate.  4 content issues resolved.  13 hours in-office, 7 at brunch.</li>\n<li>A﻿fter it was all over.  AM put out a really nice message in our department's channel thanking me for my effort in organising and running the evening, and it recieved a really solid number and variety of emoji reactions. It meant a lot - and if you're reading this, thank-you: It made me smile.</li>\n<li>Brunch at Wetherspoons (via the MP).  The additional (but unquantifiable because I was too tired to count) caffeine kept me going and after getting home I powered through until 10PM before sleeping for 10 hours solid.  It felt incredible.</li>\n<li>This week I <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/pull/2678\">moved this blog over to Fastly</a>, and in the process have put it and Cloudflare into Terraform. Fastly is one of my favourite technology products and so I’m pretty ecstatic about having it on-hand. It allowed me to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/pull/2681\">remove some Cloudflare workers</a> - I find Cloudflare’s platform unpredictable and have been spooked by recent bill-shock.</li>\n<li>Went to JL and LF’s birthday party on Saturday, which started with golf: I won at accuracy in my team, up by 150 points. It started in Watford and ended in Paddington and I made many fond memories on the day.</li>\n<li>Nearly got bingo!</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"UK Election this week.
