Loud enough to turn TK’s head.</li>\n<li>I got (only) one question wrong in our tech all-hands quiz, and am feeling slightly salty about it.</li>\n<li>Quite hyped about a few new features and bits of tech that are going live soon.</li>\n<li>Over the week I had a side-quest to assemble what I’m calling “lo-fi black-tie attire”: Including a casual black jacket, a clip-on tie and grand court 2.0s. With student discounts the whole set was silly cheap.</li>\n<li>Thursday evening I went to the Business Book Awards where my mum’s book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/191138385X\">From Grenades to Griddles</a>” won the second place award (“highly commended”) in its category - the judges were <em>super</em> complimentary and I'm so proud.</li>\n<li>The awards were a gala dinner pulling in interesting people from all over the world.  Dinner was a selection of Indian cuisine; naturally I binged on chaat.  It was too spicy for some but the staff were under the impression it was mild leading to a funny back-and-forth with the staff: Sorry VRG, I really tried!</li>\n<li>My group was a little less into talking to strangers about their books than me so I kept the old \"\"\"networking\"\"\" to a minimum. Recognised a few books and authors that I’d actually read - but the person I really wanted to meet (The Parts Unlimited guy) couldn’t make it, which allowed me to uphold my networking embargo. I did eventually break it at our table to talk about research on the behaviours of oligarchs - because how can you not?!</li>\n<li>Friday evening I caught up with the one-and-only OB at The Banker, including talking about travel and life plans, an impromptu papers review and lots of chatter about our old friends - and we also attempted to revive a few group chats of yore. Genuinely a treat.</li>\n<li>What began as a hangout turned into a surprise birthday celebration for VQM. While it included legendary Pilaf, Romanian milk and a silly amount of Just Dance - my standout moment is captured in the 20 second video clip I now have of MT reading/preaching The Communist Manifesto.</li>\n<li>The journey home was the first time I’ve talked to the cab driver the entire way (about an hour) in a very long time.  He had some <em>real</em> takes, but not the type of takes that you usually hear and immediately feel compelled to write-up on the internet.</li>\n<li>Very late last week I got an email saying I was put in for an exam on Monday this week. It’s a highly detail-oriented exam and I had no time to meaningfully revise so I didn’t even attempt it. That wound me up a bit.</li>\n<li>(Small personal victory on Sunday)</li>\n<li>The mosquito bites are finally gone, replaced by a <em>very</em> angry heel injury from attempting to wear formal shoes this week. Pray for me.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/66e0b0b9-e88a-464a-a1e1-4a2fdc7bcfe0.jpg\" alt=\"Thumbnails of scenes from the week above\" title=\"Snaps from week 38, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"An audible sigh emerged after I re-ran a Jupyter notebook and saw a result meaning I will have to delay some work.
