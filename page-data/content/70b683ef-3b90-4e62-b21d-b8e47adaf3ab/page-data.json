With the backdrop of war in Ukraine &#x26; exploring efforts to help, now feels like another time to compartmentalise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twitter has been full of some of the wildest content in years.  The irony of <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/256730a2-c09e-4319-ae77-239d05eaf15a\">writing this in weeknotes is palpable</a>, but I’m truly impressed by people who’ve attempted to make the war about them.</li>\n<li>Trying to suss out which side of the fence your late Russia-based Ukrainian family members would have come down on is emotionally ruinous.  I don’t think non-Russians understand <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/896181/putin-approval-rating-russia/\">how powerful &#x26; effective state-run media is</a>.  Independent journalism is vital.</li>\n<li>Bottom line: There’s a <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-to-donate-to-support-ukrainian-civilians-in-and-outside-ukraine/\">huge influx of Ukrainian refugees who now need support, food &#x26; shelter</a>. Your employer may offer donation matching, and if so, definitely consider taking it.  Separately if you happen to be UK based, the government will <a href=\"https://www.actionaid.org.uk/donate/emergency/dec-ukraine-humanitarian-appeal\">match <em>some</em> charitable donations</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compartmentalising? Well that’s made <em>easier</em> by continuing to avoid social media, sort-of.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d7e40da-0cf3-453e-9eb3-40036d4e2582\">Commutes this week weren’t great</a>, however in some ways I’d come to miss the chaos. More I’m looking forward to a time when office routine won’t feel like a big novelty worth reporting on.</li>\n<li>The Raspberry Pi turned 10 last week and to celebrate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/c6568ace-0da3-49bf-92d2-2b27ef4ef055\">the FT ran an 18 minute video-essay</a>, it’s pretty good, and guest-stars <a href=\"https://alicebartlett.co.uk/\">one of - just - the best people</a>.  Also the Pi Zero 2 is <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/\"><em>still</em> out of stock</a>. ☹️</li>\n<li>In Netflix News: The finale of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11704040\">Love Is Blind</a> was suitably awkward - but, the drama hasn’t concluded and now there’s a proper feud between some of the cast on Instagram.  Oh, also, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14992922/\">The Tinder Swindler</a> is pretty good — although this recent wave of true-ish crime releases on Netflix doesn’t exactly make for the most uplifting content!</li>\n<li>Brandon Sanderson <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a-k6eaT-jQ\">announced a new novel</a> and broke Kickstarter which is kinda cool I guess.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I moved back to <em>RSS-by-default</em>, Trying to mimic the nostalgia of how I read the internet in 2013:  Before “doom-scrolling” existed in the zeitgeist, and, before social media firms spent millions perfecting it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RSS-by-default is nice.  <em>Sort-of</em>.  Before this when I followed only a few blogs - basic clients were enough — However, now I get to experience the varied quality of different feeds &#x26; clients.  <a href=\"https://www.reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a> &#x26; <a href=\"http://lireapp.com/\">Lire</a> are the the best cross-platform Apple options I’ve found so far.</li>\n<li>Optimising my reader’s quality-to-quantity balance, I tried sending newsletters to it.  For some busier sites, the regular human curation &#x26; summarisation is far more readable than a standard firehose feed.  A side-benefit is that I can now follow Substack/Twitter publications!</li>\n<li>Purely anecdotally, I’m already reading more mindfully.  The distance between me &#x26; algorithmic curation is teaching me to move beyond <em>engagement</em> towards <em>understanding</em>.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"We’re now in March, and spring is upon us.
