It went well, and it felt easy even, and I left it feeling unfazed.

It was an exhibition at the Mori Art Museum on perhaps my favourite topic: In a cybernetic wold, what does it mean to be human?  I loved it all.  Three particular standouts were <a href=\"http://ayoungkim.com/wp/3col/delivery-dancers-sphere-2022\">Delivery Dancer’s Sphere</a> by Kim Ayoung (unfortunately not available online), <a href=\"http://www.calculatingempires.com/\">Calculating Empires</a> by Kate Crawford &#x26; Vladan Joler, and <a href=\"http://luyang.asia/2023/05/20/doku-the-self/\">DOKU The Self</a> by Lu Yang.</li>\n<li>No but seriously <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28452535/\">Delivery Dancer’s Sphere</a> was <em>so good</em>.  It has become a bit of a cinematic universe and I’m very here for that.  Check it out on Mubi or at the Tate or something.</li>\n<li>Saw the end of the parade and the subsequent concert at <a href=\"https://pride.tokyo\">Tokyo Rainbow Pride</a>. And I was struck by how many big company logos I saw. Even though some costumes and flags were <em>way</em> out there, the energy was <em>slightly</em> more subdued than other pride events I’ve been to, but still a thoroughly good and optimism-inducing time.</li>\n<li>Happy pride month, yeah?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w23-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 23, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 23, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"A few puzzle-pieces slotted into place this week.
