I’m actively thinking about architectural interventions to prevent scenarios exactly like this one, so this was very timely.</li>\n<li>With my plate clearer, I had an uninterrupted day to work on strategy, and made good progress.  The hardest part is always starting, so I’ve begun with Will Larson’s <a href=\"https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/\">“Write five, then synthesize”</a> approach which is <em>very</em> JFDI-minded.</li>\n<li>One afternoon, instead of lunch, on the way to the office I make a pit-stop in Toranomon Hills for a long-anticipated coffee where I learn a lot about fin-tech, a lot about founding a company in Japan and also get a great pep-talk.</li>\n<li>Amongst serious songs, at karaoke I do <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4\">the He-Man duet of “What's Up?”</a> with DS.  Later I pray that the only recording of this moment is the one now forever etched into my brain.</li>\n<li>After two false starts - which involve walking to okubo and helping set up a bunch of accounts - Friday night we end up playing Counter-Strike in a gaming cafe.  I haven’t touched CS since secondary school and I start out very rusty but we end up winning.</li>\n<li>Went to <a href=\"https://ultrajapan.com/ja\">Ultra Japan</a> on Saturday, staying at the techno stage.  Along with repeats of Artbat, Amelie Lens &#x26; Drunken Kong, I got to see Adam Beyer.  His style has changed a lot since I started following him, but <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sharam/sharam-party-all-the-time-adam\">PATT</a> is an actual banger I’ve had on repeat several times this summer and it hits different live.  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18071434163131162/\">Highlights reel here</a>.</li>\n<li>Sunday had two parts: The part involving going to the bank, and the good part.  I wasted a lot of time at the bank trying to resolve a problem which it turned out <em>was not a problem</em>.  Things like this are incredibly humbling as I realise just how little I still know about the day-to-day systems of this place I now call home.</li>\n<li>The good part involved trying shika sashi (鹿刺し) for the first time (it’s good!), accidentally almost going to a listening bar I’ve had pinned for seven(!) years, and one of the best things I’ve ever heard anyone say.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately I lost track of time and missed all three of my last connecting trains from Shinjuku, so I ran home: It’s 15 minutes, punctuated by traffic lights, which seems like a useful thing to know.</li>\n<li>Not sure if just runner’s high, but the good part made the week.  The other parts were very good too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w37-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 37, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 37, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"This was a good week?  22.53km of running.
