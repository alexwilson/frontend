Last year my assignments kept me away from the less maintained systems and so it's been surprisingly fun seeing how people approached problems several years ago - and years later, seeing how t approach aged.heir</li>\n<li>That isn't a popular opinion and it definitely isn't how I'll always feel.  Years ago I'd actively <em>sworn</em> at old code (although in my defence I defy anyone not to swear at the logic of recursive cURL calls in PHP!).   But, there's a big difference between spelunking through systems in an exploratory way, and doing so while trying to ship a specific feature on a deadline.</li>\n<li>CBT is, you know, fine.  I'm in it for the long-haul I guess.</li>\n<li>Bear with me: <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f2c2faa-cc8d-4c83-b2e4-048d5d893a27\">Last year I got an Analogue Pocket</a>.  And, last week I got a copy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Urbz:_Sims_in_the_City\">The Urbz</a>.  It seemed like a good way to all this spend time in recovery.  Only one problem, some unlocks in the game require multiplayer.  So I bought a GBA linker cable for £3, dumped my save file and re-read <a href=\"https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbacartbackupids\">how GBA saves work</a> so I could convert a cartridge EEPROM save to SRAM for a backup, so I can fake a player 2.  What a way to spend an Friday evening.</li>\n<li>In other news, over the weekend I beat The Urbz.  Listen to this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jETUw_BpaKw&#x26;t=47s\"><del>terrible</del> iconic 2003 techno</a>.  What an <em>iconic</em> game.  Playing this in my early tweens clocked me onto anti-capitalism.</li>\n<li>Think I'm coming down with something, and, I got a ping.  So now I'm continuing to vicariously relive my tweens by rewatching <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434665/\">Bleach</a>.  Forgot nearly all of the plot, but meanwhile, apparently I memorised some of the kidō incantations.  And reader? <em>I still remember them</em>.  Cringe or ironically retro?  You decide.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"There's a genuine spark of wonder that I've been feeling recently as I've been discovering and learning about the more obscure parts of the…"},"slug":"/content/0ca489c6-34ba-4571-84b9-4084c8ae318f","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":[]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"0ca489c6-34ba-4571-84b9-4084c8ae318f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
