How did <em>that</em> happen?  It was March 2020 not that long ago.</p>\n<p>At work I feel like my team is starting to make a lot of progress quite quickly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I guess now that half-term is over, we're in the last \"sprint\" of the year?</li>\n<li>A few initiatives on my plate have sped up which makes them harder to balance, but, that's a good thing because it's nudged me to change tact in some and delegate a little more in others.</li>\n<li>Particularly exciting is planning the change/removal of a few bits of consistent process &#x26; technology debt which we've previously worked around the hard way.</li>\n<li>We were optimising locally a lot: Solving problems per-team and sharing notes, but not giving reusable solutions. Ignoring hindsight bias, I still think it was the best thing to do at the time (giving small teams much more autonomy) but it's really refreshing looking forward at the slightly bigger picture.</li>\n<li>Really I'm just thrilled to see things coming together.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Monday I was offered an exciting opportunity which originally, I thought would be a no-brainer. It's been sitting with me all week...</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://alexkondov.com/\">Alex</a> would remind me that <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/341035-we-suffer-more-often-in-imagination-than-in-reality\">“We suffer much more in imagination than reality”</a>, and I know that it's right?  But, <em>still...</em></li>\n<li>The experience has encouraged me to revisit my (vague) career goals, which is always a good thing.  That's where this post title comes from.</li>\n<li>This whole exercise has helped me understand that my desire to move (temporarily, but who knows?) from engineering into product management is much more than a desire and — if nothing else — that is something I wish I'd realised much sooner.</li>\n<li>As an engineer I'm personally motivated by disparate problem-areas and love deep-dives into problems across domains and technology - which is probably why I've become \"full-stack\"?  Some time ago I learned that the behavioural pattern of returning to horizontal-problem spaces so frequently aligns me closest to a generalist.</li>\n<li>So far this all tracks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generally though as we approach December, people are beginning to introspect on the year.  The yearnotes posts which have appeared so far are fantastic — it's really cool seeing how much people have done.  Between starting with this exercise &#x26; having a healthy amount of time booked away in December ... another thing to do, hum.</p>\n<p>This weekend also marked the point of me finishing my first track to the point where I'm relatively happy to share it.  While I wait to gather some feedback, I made the mistake of looking into how music distribution works...  The short answer is that (even for free) it involves printing &#x26; signing a lot of international tax forms.  Huzzah for bureaucracy &#x26; paperwork.</p>","excerpt":"Reader, we're six weeks away from the end of 2021.  How did that happen?  It was March 2020 not that long ago.
