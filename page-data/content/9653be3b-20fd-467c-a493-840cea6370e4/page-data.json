It was cyclical. It had highs and lows. And I unlocked some unactualised personal growth.</li>\n<li>This week in data:\n<ul>\n<li>Distance walked: 112,780 steps</li>\n<li>Conversations: 14 phone-calls</li>\n<li>Jitter: 10ms</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The internet saga has concluded: For reasons unclear to anyone, I’m on a VDSL line which runs parallel to the gigabit ethernet already in my building. It doesn’t matter much since the central switch is still capped.  But it’s enough: I can now finally take video-calls at home.</li>\n<li>The week begins with two high stakes conversations. For both, I believed that I was not equipped, so I assembled a brain trust.  And reader, the brain trust <em>really</em> came through.</li>\n<li>Both conversations are call-backs to previous conversations from my past, and despite being <em>completely</em> thematically unrelated, I have tactlessly avoided both for the longest time.  But this week I saw the avoidant link, and decided to change that.  Equipped with advice, second-opinions and vibes: both actually went well.  I surprised myself with the tools and ideas I had collected, as well as reasoning about which advice I got was good - and which was not.  Scary things are not so scary.  And asking for help isn’t either.</li>\n<li>Relatedly, the facet5 continues to be one of the most useful things I’ve ever done.  At the time I said “We live in our blind-spots” and ever since then, (combined with older psychometric tests) it has been like a power-torch.</li>\n<li>Connected to both conversations, I also reconnected with an old-friend. I'm pretty happy with that.</li>\n<li>One evening in a cellar in Kanda, after <em>far</em> too many years, I met the venerable JS for some Okonomiyaki. Probably the biggest meal I’ve had since the big move — because I only accidentally went and ordered the bajillion-course prix-fixe nomihoudai didn't I? Anyway: The way things are going, there’s a very real chance that SC ends up happening in Tokyo in a year or so.</li>\n<li>This week’s sound-track was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_May_Vary\">Results May Vary</a>.</li>\n<li>To drown our related sorrows, we met up near Sanchome to visit a snack bar for delicious crab, followed by a spiritual experience in a Buddhist bar.  We made friends with a nearby table, recited some prayers and drew some characters from the Taishō Tripiṭaka.  I picked 願.  Did OK for someone who has never done calligraphy before.</li>\n<li>Spent a bit of time exploring LB’s old yard, including the gallery which didn’t exist this time two years ago.</li>\n<li>On Saturday afternoon, we met at Ueno park to go to the Taiwan festival, where I was introduced to a lot of very delicious food and drink.  With the exception of mystery meat in my beef bowl, everything was delightful.  I don’t pretend to understand Taiwan: From the outside it seems to be a place of contradictions, but good lord do these contradictions taste and sound great.  I want to visit there.</li>\n<li>Closing the weekend NH &#x26; I met in Shinjuku and quickly found Michelin-star mapo doufu, before an impromptu deep-dive introduction into Pachinko and slot-machines from an actual expert.  For the low price of losing 一千円 I tried several machines and while I don’t feel the pull to return, I now understand the mechanics, regulation and community much better.</li>\n<li>BTW, I’ve updated this blog’s style-guide. Use of the royal “we” is still banned.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w25-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 25, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 25, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Reader, this week - in an entirely positive way - was rather a lot.
