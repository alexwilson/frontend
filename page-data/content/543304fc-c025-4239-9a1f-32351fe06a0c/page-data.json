This time it’s Chiyoda, and instead of having translated forms, they have actual interpreters. The hardest part is writing out kanji. Done and done in record time.</li>\n<li>This week we go to war.  In my new bathroom, there is a smell which I can’t identify, locate or label.  It’s not an unpleasant smell, but, it’s definitely not a pleasant one either.  It smells a lot like soap, but, <em>sweet</em>?  Research and conversations suggest that it’s the product of a “bio-film”, which is a brand new type of home maintenance problem that I’d rather not have learned about.  I steadily arm myself with every category of cleaning product.</li>\n<li>Wrapping Monday I run (literally) from work in the pouring rain to see US, one of my favourite all-time people who is in town for one night and one night only.  Over reasonably-priced yakiniku we talk bikes and the expo in a room which — by medium of sharpie — very loudly shares my politics.</li>\n<li>Okonomiyaki in Sumida-city is lots of fun, but not as fun as a nearby cafe staffed by robots which say “arigatou-nya”.</li>\n<li>It’s a short week at work, and I’ve mostly been preparing to trial something and to migrate something else.  There’s a lot of Google Docs involved.</li>\n<li>After work on Wednesday I’m in Shibuya again, this time to buy a bed.  <a href=\"nitori-net.jp/\">Nitori</a> are trialling a new service where they help pick everything.  I walk out with a considerably lighter wallet.</li>\n<li>Off to Azabujuban for a long walk around the various towers framing Roppongi.  Unfortunately all the good views have closed for the day.  But Tokyo Tower is still lit up, and there’s a building which what looks like five entire stories of bar.</li>\n<li>Breaking news! We have made some headway against the biofilm.  The holy trinity of enzymatic drain cleaner, bleach and strong ventilation have led to the best possible bathroom smell of them all: None.  Can we keep this up?</li>\n<li>Friday brings a grilled lamb dinner welcoming the 2025 new graduates to our department.  It was fantastic.  When I started my first job, I got a McChicken sandwich and fries, and <a href=\"https://normal-people.com/blogs/the-wine-tastes-less\">coloured in nostalgia</a> I’m still not sure which was better.</li>\n<li>Dashed from the dinner to get to Ginza - in record time again - to meet AG, OS and MP for what looks suspiciously like a product management meetup but is really a sort-of holiday debrief.  It’s great hearing what other people did, because it kindles the spark that keeps me interested in travelling.</li>\n<li>In Yokohama’s Minato Mirai there are heaps of Storm Troopers and equal sized crowds of children and adults queuing for early Star Wars day selfies.  There’s some surprisingly bland Brazilian food outside the Red Brick Warehouse.  Final stop is Chinatown, where there’s a spontaneous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_dance\">Lion Dance</a> which seems to follow.</li>\n<li>I accompany MP on the way to the airport, to stop in Narita City on the way.  Naturally, it’s the wrong train, and we end up in neighbouring Sakura.  There’s a windmill, a mahoosive park, and some very clean air.  Which is a very happy accident.  Later we end up in Narita City for some yakitori before parting ways.  I bought some peanut cookies.  <em>Now</em> I can say that I’ve explored Chiba.</li>\n<li>Still no smell.  Heck yes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w18-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 18, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 18, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Another month, another ward office trip.
