So begins the longest holiday in a while, and a firm resolution to take many more holidays next year.</li>\n<li>With Twitter becoming increasingly censored &#x26; unstable, I'm redoing my site metadata to be less Twitter specific.  <a href=\"https://metatags.io\">Metatags.io</a> has been helpful resource for testing and previewing, and while I'm not using it, <a href=\"https://og-image.xyz\">og-image.xyz</a> seems handy for generating images in a pinch.</li>\n<li>Despite all odds, over the year I made a decent dent in my objectives including getting all of my team specific objectives over the line.  I haven't done so well with my non-work objectives, so the next two weeks offer a chance to focus on one or two! ðŸ˜¬</li>\n<li>In an upsetting-yet-damning inditement of <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/20bf537b-e7c7-45f5-be35-35f3e1b2b586\">what I wrote about language-learning last year</a>, this week I got the results of a formal Japanese language assessment.  I scored 70%, but, the comment read that my knowledge is \"patchy\" because I've \"used multiple textbooks\".  Yep.  Really wish people would stop telling me to \"<em>just self-study</em>\".  Moderately angry.</li>\n<li>The combination of train strikes (deliberately) making getting around very difficult &#x26; slow and a cold snap placing snow &#x26; ice everywhere meant lots of plans completely falling apart.  Including running, which I didn't do much of as it turns out that trail and running shoes don't really grip ice.</li>\n<li>However at some cost to my sleep, this week still included a few highlights including unlimited wings and industry gossip in Clapham, twice getting lost in Soho and free Lychee liquor in Southwark.  Next stop - Brum for the holidays.</li>\n<li>Recently I finished <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12005128/\">WeCrashed</a>, a dramatization of the WeWork story.  Many of the plot-points were familiar because I've read so much about them lately, but unlike the books, the show painted a much more sympathetic picture of Adam &#x26; Rebekah Neumann.  I'm starting to think that capitalism is the true villain of this story.</li>\n<li>Much like Adam did WeWork, on Thursday <a href=\"https://ghost.computer\">Kara</a> âœ¨manifestedâœ¨ a screening of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095016/\">Die Hard</a> complete with <a href=\"https://github.com/apaleslimghost/argyle\">a Twitch-style chat</a> for including remote viewers and it was great. <a href=\"https://www.thegadhian.com\">Arjun</a> got a dump of the chat from previous screenings ran a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee\">VAR-style</a> real-time analysis of the best (and worst!) comments from years gone by.  Nice memory to close work with this year.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Unceremoniously closing my laptop on Friday evening also closed my last day of work for the year.
