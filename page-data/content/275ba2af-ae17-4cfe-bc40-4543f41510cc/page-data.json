Even my Sainsbury’s meal-deal on Wednesday cooccurred with interesting chat.  Spent a lot of time in VCV Rack in the evenings working on dangerous new hobby.</li>\n<li>My team had our first all-in-person retro in a little while and after our normal retro app refused to work, got to use real post-it notes on a whiteboard.</li>\n<li>We welcomed a new member to our team this week, and I’m incredibly excited to work with him.  We’re working in the same two areas.</li>\n<li>You see, it all comes back to google sheets?</li>\n<li>Had a 2-hour debrief on my <a href=\"https://www.facet5global.com/\">Facet5 profile</a>, and while I suspect I answered some questions strangely and potentially distorted my scores, the general gist felt bang-on.  I’m a “<a href=\"https://family.facet5gps.com/promoter/\">Promoter</a>”.  Lots of interesting things that I can now work on, because I see my blindspots more clearly than after exercises <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/cdf6575f-d01f-43bb-8a26-eb1530ca9952/\">like the Johari window</a>.  I’m hyped.</li>\n<li>This week’s major update to the blog was <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/pull/2715\">an overhaul of the typography, implementing a fluid scale</a>, meaning text is now bigger and more legible for mobile readers, and that this blog’s codebase is simpler as a result.</li>\n<li>I’d put typography off for <em>ages</em> as it involved fiddly maths: There are now two font size scales: <a href=\"http://www.modularscale.com/?16,28&#x26;px&#x26;1.25&#x26;web&#x26;text\">Small</a> and <a href=\"http://www.modularscale.com/?20,40&#x26;px&#x26;1.333&#x26;web&#x26;text\">Large</a> and for each font size we plot the slope (and intercept) of the difference between the Small and Large scales, convert it to viewport units, and wrap it inside a <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/css-math-functions\">CSS clamp</a>.  <a href=\"https://modern-fluid-typography.vercel.app?rootFontSize=16&#x26;minSize=28&#x26;fluidSize=2&#x26;relativeSize=1&#x26;maxSize=40\">This is (almost) what that slope looks like for headings</a>!</li>\n<li>This was <a href=\"https://edg.foo/\">Ed’s</a> last week at the FT, and, his characteristically relaxed leaving drinks which ended sitting on the steps of The Thames.  Ed - I’ll miss our natters about micro-frontends and dataviz: Godspeed.</li>\n<li>Spent Thursday evening with some of my favourite people on a mini-pub-crawl in Southfields.  Learned about a new sandwich place, and a friendly bartender pitched this little-known EDR called CrowdStrike...  Maybe you’ve heard of it?</li>\n<li>Visited FS’s new place on Saturday to admire his medal collection, armed with <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2024-06-12/denmark-bans-extremely-hot-noodles-used-in-tiktok-spice-challenge\">interesting spicy snacks</a>.  He &#x26; V plied us with Aperol Spritz’ and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coxinha\">Coxinha</a> which are a <em>delightful</em> new find.  Three Glastonbury replays and <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/football/match/_/gameId/699526/internacional-botafogo\">one football match later</a>, I’d won at a game of Codenames and made the long journey home.</li>\n<li>On Sunday, met LF &#x26; TM at Charing Cross for a long stroll. We popped by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Chariots\">Ratha Yatra</a> and a stranger introduced us to the festival’s history. I learned lots and so was <em>understandably</em> surprised by the sudden pivot to a Covid conspiracy twenty minutes in. To recover, we armed ourselves with Boba and made it as far as Hackney Central via London Fields, Regent’s Canal and the Barbican.  Weather was spot-on.</li>\n<li>He was Biden his time.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"A week of interesting lunches. Even my Sainsbury’s meal-deal on Wednesday cooccurred with interesting chat.
