The main thing I wanted to get from the kick-off was getting alignment, and I think we did it.  Also I designed a timeline chart which I'm weirdly proud of.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My mid-year review was on Wednesday.  On the whole, really nice feedback.  Some feedback came up about how I do (or seem to do) too much, which I need to ponder a bit: My strategy has been having no more than 3 big things in-flight at a time (they tend to run on, so, you know) - and <a href=\"https://alicebartlett.co.uk/\">Alice</a> suggested that I may have the <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/prioritising-in-tech-leadership.html#rocks-pebbles-and-sand-to-focus-our-time\">Rocks, Pebbles and Sand problem</a>.  I think she's right.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Weirdest thing I did this week was find and buy a single Macbook key.  The minus key.  A few months ago I damaged one of the keys, and it has slowly come loose.  I managed to find one online and after swapping out the assembly my keyboard is as good as new.  <em>(Screen still needs a clean!)</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't know if you've clocked it yet, but next year marks between 2 and 4 elections.  That's quite a lot.  I had a few conversations/meetings about what to do for them next year.  There's not much more to say <em>yet</em>, but I'm excited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thursday marked Mo's leaving drinks and a large contingency of people who came to say goodbye.  It had everything: Mystery, Intrigue and Drama.  I learned a <strong>lot</strong> about FreeNow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Assuming a cylindrical penguin in a perfect vacuum...</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Randomly over the week I played (and finished) two re-releases of Nintendo DS games: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1967430\">Ghost Trick</a> and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/477740\">Zero Escape</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ghost Trick (by some of the same people as Ace Attorney) I'd played a long time ago, but long enough ago that I'd forgotten the story, so I got to experience it again, in HD.  I had a <em>great</em> time and I love how novel the gameplay elements actually are.  It's a shame they never made a second one.</li>\n<li>Zero Escape escaped (<em>sorry</em>) my attention when it was first released and it blew me away: Very reminiscent of some of my favourite visual novels (you may know what they are) and without giving anything away, I loved how the story unconventionally worked around the fourth wall.  Slightly graphic, but nothing compared to <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/9c7263f6-3aea-4217-9b14-952468c41b53\">Knife Party</a> (which I think, on reflection, relied on shock to cover up that it was just plain silly).</li>\n<li>As a bonus both had <a href=\"https://youtu.be/P0cHLd2BL34?t=169\">absolute</a> <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PkODG5eHcTI?t=1473\">bangers</a> of soundtracks.  You should check them both out.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sunday we grabbed lunch in Brick Lane for lunch (mine was takoyaki and what I think was some kind of cursed fried sushi?), followed by a slow walk via Spitalfields (and Chai Guys) to the Barbican. We ended in Tooting for dinner and ate too much Dosa.  I now understand why people eat with their hands - it's so uncomfortably ... <em>liberating</em>.  But there was no other way.  There was no other way.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w31.jpg\" alt=\"Week 31, 2023\" title=\"Week 31, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"Highlight of this week was prepping and giving a presentation to kick-off some work I've been doing since June, the thing I've referred to…"},"slug":"/content/d1d03567-affa-4737-833d-b2b03106a334","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":[]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"d1d03567-affa-4737-833d-b2b03106a334"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
