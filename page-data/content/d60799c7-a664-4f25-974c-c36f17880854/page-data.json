While writing I'm drinking my first (and maybe last) latte and can already feel the power of being so, so basic surging through my veins.</li>\n<li>At work, more and more teams have begun blogging semi-regularly.  It's very energising reading about their progress (and I <em>love</em> the occasional deep-dives).</li>\n<li>I upgraded to the iPhone 14 Pro, going for the smaller model after I found the 11 Pro Max a shade too big.

We're in a time machine rapidly heading to the golden era of an unregulated financial system - because that has always ended well.</li>\n<li>Still running btw.</li>\n<li>With <a href=\"https://time.com/6215461/carbon-dioxide-beer-shortage/\">a beer shortage on the horizon</a>, now feels like a good time to get really into whiskey highballs.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Reader, Autumn is here, marking the much-anticipated return of pumpkin spice.
