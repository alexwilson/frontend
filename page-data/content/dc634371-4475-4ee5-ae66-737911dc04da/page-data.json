Smol milestone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lxds I did it, I've got a Splunk dashboard named after me.  <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/6dcc00c2-ac66-4569-b76b-e17c3114c264\">Remember the hackathon?</a>  Turns out I was sending a large number of requests.  Probably because my Google Script add-on implemented retries, and I was sending at least 200 individual requests, therefore maybe accidentally doing a denial-of-service against our internal LLM.  Whoops!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Also spent a bit of time this week supporting my team in editorial with adopting notebooks via SageMaker.  It's off to a rocky start so far, but it's mostly AWS related challenges - permissions and images and such.  I really wish AWS was significantly more user friendly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Friday I spent a couple of hours on a 10%-time project that I've been excited about for a while, which is restoring some of the digital signage I worked on several years ago.  Mostly spent the time scaffolding out a new project (porting from PHP to Node) and exploring data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In slightly unwelcome news, I got a huge rent hike this week and I'm not thrilled about it.  I negotiated it down to about 14% but this has lit a fire under my desire to buy.  ASDF.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776/\">Oppenheimer</a> with TM and Lucy this week and - it may be the best thing I've ever seen.  I loved the story, the build into the Trinity test and the continuation as the story evolved.  It was in the BMI IMAX so I was sitting in the very corner, but it was still visually stunning even if everything was a shade wonky.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In other films news, I watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt19500164/\">Nimona</a> with Laura &#x26; Sara which was visually stunning if somewhat goofy - and finally watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/\">The Wolf of Wall Street</a> which I kinda hated every minute of (but I think that's the point?).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learned a lot about Japanese corporate finance on Wednesday at drinks with CL.  Very revelatory stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finishing 999 last week, I played through its sequel - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Escape:_Virtue%27s_Last_Reward\">Virtue's Last Reward</a> which I enjoyed - but it got super samey because it involves lots of repetition, and story's ending felt super convoluted.  Interesting premise but 999 actually drew me in, this felt like a grind.  I texted a few people about the story and its inconsistencies and think I'm having a corkboard-and-red-string moment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Closed the week with a mini-Bermondsey-beer-mile on Sunday, which is code for Vinegar Yard and Cloudwater.  <a href=\"https://untappd.com/b/cloudwater-brew-co-unsolicited-poetry/5414273\">Unsolicited Poetry</a> is probably the tastiest beer I've ever</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w32.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 32, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 32, 2023\"></p>\n<p>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"After working at the FT for a long time, finally this week I made a change to the homepage.
