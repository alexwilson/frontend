Still, this post marks a consecutive year since <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/278059da-8c59-4a6e-8992-1530f9630ab8\">resuming weeknotes</a> and so Iâ€™m in a celebratory mood.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One helpful tweak was slightly systemising the process, leading to the format youâ€™re reading now. Sticking to a few themes and expanding on them in bullet-points contains thoughts and avoids editorialising.</li>\n<li>In the past weeknotes were about forming a writing habit - so in the past I wrote about tech, sometimes at a stretch. But this past year theyâ€™ve been a chance to write about things going on in my life, and things I find interesting with as little censorship as possible.</li>\n<li>Engagement on Twitter is also way down compared to 2018, which others have pointed out is for mostly algorithmic reasons and thereâ€™s a whole slightly-ranty essay in there. But major kudos to all you RSS folk: I donâ€™t know who you are but - one-time offer - drop me a note and Iâ€™ll buy you a coffee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the week itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I beat Dread Mode on Monday, which was something of a feat. For the uninitiated, thatâ€™s a play-through of Metroid Dreadâ€™s highest difficulty in which a single hit results in a game-over. Itâ€™s been a real trial of patience but feels better than last yearâ€™s feat of reaching end-game in Phantasy Star Online.</li>\n<li>On Wednesday I had a lot of fun debugging a broken SAML integration. I set out with big dreams and an open log-file, and ended up re-reading the docs. It worked first time: A lesson I wish Iâ€™d stop re-learning.</li>\n<li>Helped by recent events at work and informed by the <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/7c3ed03c-7f97-4e2b-897b-5cf10f830bb0\">excellent advice at LeadingEng</a>, Iâ€™ve made good progress towards one of my objectives: Coming up with a career plan. By mapping my values, Iâ€™ve narrowed down what Iâ€™d like to do to three areas and have begun mapping my skills against roles on those paths. Speaking to other engineers itâ€™s surprising how few of us actively plan this way - something we should change!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/92/\">Rowan has mentioned</a> this week has been quite fun with <a href=\"https://ghost.computer/\">Kara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thegadhian.com/\">Arjun</a> and Gallalâ€™s birthdays and dinner with <a href=\"https://www.lily2point0.com/\">Lily</a>, resulting in 2 trips to Pizza Pilgrims and at least 5 pizzas. Iâ€™m tired of pizza.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Following last weekâ€™s heatwave, Victoria Parkâ€™s luscious bright greens have faded to more autumnal shades of red and gold. Sitting on charred grass, I couldnâ€™t ignore the writing on the wall.</li>\n<li>Getting to and from Victoria Park during a train strike was exciting. Road trip there, District-line trek back.</li>\n<li>Anyway Iâ€™ve eaten and drunk far too much this week. ðŸ˜¬</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"They say it takes 21 days to form a habit, even if disappointingly it turns out that thereâ€™s no such magical number.
