Alas I will continue to primarily exist in these for a little while longer.</li>\n<li>I really liked this post on <a href=\"https://tk.gg/posts/ai-alt-text\">using AI to generate image captions</a> by Matt.</li>\n<li>Now that I’ve got the equipment I cooked at home a lot this week, which meant braving buying ingredients I didn’t 100% understand and re-learning how to cook without the luxury of counter-top space.  Never before have I missed owning a dishwasher as much as I do now.</li>\n<li>Didn’t do much last week, which is why there’s no week 40.  What began as feeling run-down blossomed into full blown sickness.  By the time I saw my doctor I tested negative for everything, but whatever this was took a serious toll on my energy levels, mood and focus and I’m still recovering bit-by-bit.</li>\n<li>That meant staying in and playing <a href=\"https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=85013\">The Great Ace Attorney</a> which is cheesy as all hell and goes hard on stereotyping England.  Doubling-down, I watched some <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005363/\">Guy Ritchie</a> movies: It <em>really</em> wasn’t a good week for learning Japanese.</li>\n<li>Some funny stories are stacking up which I will never write down - not on this blog nor SNS nor IM.  The most recent is last week’s story of me getting a Covid test: It was negative.  Ask me about it after 3 drinks.</li>\n<li>This weekend I got up early (I <em>can</em> do it S!) to meet some friends at Shinjuku to hike Mt. Takao.  The weather was miserable meaning zero visibility at the top, but we still made it up in good time and stopped for yakiniku in Chofu on the way back.</li>\n<li>Went to the <a href=\"https://www.dmcdjchamps.com/\">World DJ Championships</a>, where I watched <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/djfummy\">DJ Fummy</a> perform an impressive set claiming the 2025 title, finally saw <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/skratchbastid\">Skratch Bastid</a> do one of his trademark crazy scratch routines live (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlNbZK7TP8o\">this lives rent free in my head</a>) and saw rare showcases by both the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisibl_Skratch_Piklz\">Invisibl Skratch Picklz</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireek\">Kireek</a>.  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17846346969562888\">Highlight reel is here</a>.  This was the DMC’s 40th anniversary, so the energy was <em>phenomenal</em>, and there’s heaps more I haven’t the space to write about including many surprise inductees to the Hall of Fame.</li>\n<li>The rest of the weekend was considerably more chill: Went to the suburbs with a bottle of Georgian wine in-hand to make pizza, drink and not over-think.  I think all three missions were successful?  I even managed not to over-share.  Learned about Cheesecake theory.  Didn’t do much walking.</li>\n<li>Huh, I sure am getting a lot of IG likes all of a sudden.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w42-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 41, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 41, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Hi, it’s me, I’ve been properly in the weeds of Google Docs and YAML.
