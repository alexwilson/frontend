We discovered a nice ramen place, and I discovered a cool candlelit bar.</li>\n<li>Flew home on Wednesday (but managed to sneak a final sauna in). Thanks to the magic of travel-hacking, I flew business for £25, which is cheaper than the budget route.</li>\n<li>My first Berlin Brandenburg experience went like this: “Gosh, this airport is pretty nice.
