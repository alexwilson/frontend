Finding the problem was super affirming.</li>\n<li>Did a little intro in the engineering all-hands. It’s hard to distill yourself into a slide but I think I got away with it.  (it had pictures and I got distracted mid-sentence by the chat trying to identify one!)</li>\n<li>Closed the week with the really big yearly all-hands. My head is still spinning!</li>\n<li>Met up with JK &#x26; FT for dinner in a wine bar in Shimbashi to reminisce, and learned more about how all these visas work in the process. Also walked away slightly more optimistic about learning the language.</li>\n<li>The 21st was the winter solstice, and marking the occasion I went to the incredibly packed Hōjōji in Waseda to pick up a <a href=\"https://katnsatoshiinjapan.blogspot.com/2020/12/ichiyo-raifuku.html\">Ichiyo Raifuku</a>.</li>\n<li>It needs attaching to the wall, facing the right direction at exactly midnight.  Unfortunately I didn’t have a surface facing the right direction, so instead it is now sitting on a shelf.  Maybe my next place will have a more opportune spot.</li>\n<li>Another big achievement this week was finally locating a copy of <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/metroid-fusion\">Metroid Fusion</a>.  I’ve been trawling store after store when I get the chance.  Why look for it?  Like many GBA games in Japanese, it has a mode with the simpler alphabets (the kana) and I could use the practice.  It also includes hard mode!</li>\n<li>Did a few viewings at the weekend, and some of the places I saw were nice, affordable and walking distance to the office.  But I’m not sold on the area - it’s too fiddly to get around.</li>\n<li>If you compute all places on or within the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line\">Yamanote line</a>, where there is an intersection of 3+ train lines, you end up with a large number of surprisingly affordable places.  Doing the same in London with the Circle line - I famously gave up there and honestly regretted it.</li>\n<li>Bumped into MA very randomly on Sunday evening while standing at a crossing and getting my bearings. Led to an impromptu tour of the area and dinner. And drinks. And that's also why these notes are late, sorry!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w51-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 51, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 51, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"Spent a bit of this week debugging an infrastructure problem in an unfamiliar stack, and I’m really enjoying this period of discovery…"},"slug":"/content/06fd4e46-dd48-4650-90aa-ec4ecde32479"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"06fd4e46-dd48-4650-90aa-ec4ecde32479"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","955950066"],"slicesMap":{}}
