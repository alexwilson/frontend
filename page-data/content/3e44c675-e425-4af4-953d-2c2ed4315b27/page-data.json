South Park is lovely!</li>\n<li>Between catching-up &#x26; work, I also did a midterm exercise on Algorithms: The hardest part was revising pseudocode! ðŸ˜…</li>\n<li>Unfortunately though not all was good, and politics came to a head resulting in a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/bulgarian-government-faces-no-confidence-vote-political-turmoil-2022-06-22/\">government shutdown</a>. Meanwhile the US supreme court, in a heartbreaking regression to human rights, has put many in medical peril. RMT in the UK are also fighting for workers rights. Thereâ€™s a strange energy in the air right now.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What brought me here was the chance to, face-to-face work with colleagues on <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/96a83745-76dc-47dc-8294-eae333aec62d\">the product coexistence challenge</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We ran through a list of product &#x26; tech capabilities and identified common themes with each around Ownership &#x26; Focus, Real-Estate and Enablement. These themes a great starting point for a diagnosis.</li>\n<li>Nothing we learned was surprising, which meant we were already well aligned, but it still was useful to talk through everything. The realisation that many of our constraints arenâ€™t technology reinforces my view that itâ€™s all solvable.</li>\n<li>Next steps are, continuing in a working group to draft a proposal including some suggested next actions.

My main regret is not starting on this sooner while it was fresher in memory. This is the case for a lot of my writing, so I believe to meet my objective of writing more, I need to start on drafts far sooner.</li>\n<li>Fighting anti-malware related slowdowns, Iâ€™ve got a few further in-progress features on my site, although Iâ€™m now trying to decide if I implement them in Gatsby or in whatever I replace it with.</li>\n<li>I now have a plan for how I should assemble my site: Instead of static vs. dynamic, Iâ€™m going to try and do both.
