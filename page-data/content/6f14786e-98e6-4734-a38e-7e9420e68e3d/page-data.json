To add pomp and circumstance to my 2026 resolution, after some cat-sitting, I ventured all the way to Ome, and in exchange for cash and a few words of broken Japanese, returned triumphant with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daruma_doll\">Daruma</a> the size of a voluptuous pineapple.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately I woke up the next day with a throat <em>so</em> sore that eating hurt.  This was not a great start to the week, and between working from home and staying (mostly) indoors most of my escapades involved housework.</li>\n<li>But: One of my chores involved contacting some law firms.  Most wrote back.  One, with an address in one of Tokyo’s “nicest” business districts, emailed me a quote with so many zeroes that my head is still spinning.</li>\n<li>Back in Japanese class for this term, and it’s certainly a difficulty notch higher.  I can rattle off the self introductions fairly unprompted now.</li>\n<li>After some wrangling, we re-did the branding for my department for an all-hands presentation.  I’m sticking <em>hard</em> to the comms plan I bundled my strategy into, and was pleased to see the chat go “3 Es!” as I was presenting my slides.</li>\n<li>Recently I’ve referenced <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/russells-strategy-advice.html\">this article on Russell Davies's strategy advice</a> several times.</li>\n<li>I felt OK on Friday, but a rare total shut-down of both of my train-lines (also the two busiest lines in Tokyo: Yamanote and Chou) kept me stuck at home.</li>\n<li>Friday night I ventured to Mizonokochi for a very good shinnenkai followed by nijikai at what turned out to be a branch of the same gyoza place we went to in Shibuya. Very good end to the week, and start of the year.  I discovered “Plum wine in hot water” and it’s a dangerous combination.</li>\n<li>At the weekend I went to <a href=\"https://sonic.gmo/\">GMO Sonic</a>.  I thought last year’s line-up was better, but I’ve always wanted to check out <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/tiesto\">Tiësto</a> and I saw some DJs I know in another city were going, so I went.  It was pretty good!  And I had never seen <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/domdolla\">Dom Dolla</a> before, but his set was fantastic and I’ll definitely look out for him in future posters.  <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17985426359938131/\">Highlights reel here</a>.</li>\n<li>We seek it thus, and take to the sky.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w3-2026.jpg\" alt=\"Weeknotes for week 3, 2026\" title=\"Weeknotes for week 3, 2026\"></p>","excerpt":"I’m now a wallet phone case guy.
