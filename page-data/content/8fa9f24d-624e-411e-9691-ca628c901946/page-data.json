We ideated and diverged in all the ways a good design sprint should and wrapped up with a series of case-studies including <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/\">Observable</a>, <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> at the NYT and web-components in mid-2010s Methode.  Next steps are deeper dives into the tech and orchestrating some kind of reconvergence.</li>\n<li>Phew.  I made it to the end of one administrative labyrinth.  It took a surprising amount of time.  Ready for another.</li>\n<li>This week I started using <a href=\"https://zed.dev\">Zed</a> a bit for development.  It's not as fully-featured as VSCode, but, it does support language servers and <em>it</em>. <em>is</em>. <em>fast</em>.  Like so fast.  It's bringing me back to the days when I used Sublime Text for everything.</li>\n<li>Mixed mental health week this week.  Some of the tools I've picked up recently <em>are</em> helping and I'm feeling less anxiety and apathy, but, I've also been particularly bad at masking and people have noticed - which is - <em>ehhhhhhhh</em> not helping.</li>\n<li>What better way to deal than to go with friends to watch one of the final screenings of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14209916/\">Cocaine Bear</a>?  God. Damn.  There's a particularly morbid scene involving an ambulance - <em>you know the one if you've seen it</em> - which had me and the rest of the cinema in hysterical laughter.  It is the closest you'll ever get to Patrick Bateman energy.  Highly recommended.</li>\n<li>Nintendo's announcement that they're shutting down the 3DS and Wii U eShops prompted me to revive my 3DS. I replaced the shell with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/13/8033445/new-3ds-xl-majoras-mask-monster-hunter-images\">Majoras Mask special edition</a> and installed <a href=\"https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Luma3DS\">Luma3DS</a> so I can side-load all of the digital-only content that is no longer for sale.  And I own at least two cartridges, so, you know, that's fun.</li>\n<li>We're going to see this start happening with more and more digital content stores and it's deeply saddening - my music collection still hasn't recovered from the shutdown of Google Play Music.</li>\n<li>じゃ、また。</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Loved that on budget day all I saw on various news channels was teacher & train strikes.
