Gosh it’s been warm this week, and the pollen (in London, at least) has been going haywire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I started taking antihistamines, which help but now there’s a whole host of other annoyances to contend with.</li>\n<li>Anyway in news <em>entirely</em> unrelated to antihistamines resulting in unpredictable sleep, I’m writing this from Heathrow airport, sipping a breakfast of a Bloody Mary. The last real all-nighter I pulled was in 2019 to get to the same airport lounge, to catch the exact same flight. How weird.</li>\n<li>It’s all good though, I got a <em>lot</em> of housework done and even drafted some future blog-posts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On Wednesday, the FT’s Japanese culture club invited in <a href=\"http://www.urasenke.co.uk/about-us.html\">Urasenke</a> who ran a tea ceremony.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It was <em>Chado chakai</em>, I believe, or the more casual version of the event. After a short history lesson about <a href=\"https://www.urasenke.org/tradition/\">the arrival of tea in Japan</a>, our host started talking about the cultural undertones.</li>\n<li>Our whole room sat in silence, as we watched a demonstration of the ceremony itself. It didn’t have a great deal many moving parts, but that turns out to be entirely the point. Every action in the ceremony itself has deep connotations &#x26; people spend decades honing the art.</li>\n<li>Each ceremony is intentionally a once-in-a-lifetime, folks invite their friends, families &#x26; colleagues to share the experience and it’s as much a shared artistic experience, like a concert, as an occasion where folks drink tea. I’m glad I got to share this one.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recently I’ve been reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60846261-software-architecture-metrics\">Software Architecture Metrics</a> and I’m really enjoying it, here are a few (of several) highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fitness functions come up quite a bit. The concept is simple, but <em>very</em> cool: Like their namesake in machine learning - they’re an objective measure which help [quickly] validate when desired behaviour veers off-course. Think a unit-test (eg in <a href=\"https://www.archunit.org/\">ArchUnit</a>) which validates that your codebase follows MVC.</li>\n<li>One chapter talks about measurement of software quality, more holistically, and how it can be a useful suite to prioritise. Firstly, we’re forced to ensure we’ve thought about how to measure security, performance, functional-suitability, etc. Secondly, the data helps us see when our system architecture doesn’t reflect the priorities of the underlying product.</li>\n<li>Another chapter talks about the <a href=\"https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/vsm/dora-metrics#what-are-DORA-metrics\">DORA metrics</a> in a pragmatic, practical way. It includes common pitfalls &#x26; obstacles (such as the common big one - change failure tickets!) and some suggested alternatives &#x26; mitigations, closing with suggested ways of visualising each metric over time!</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Hi reader!
