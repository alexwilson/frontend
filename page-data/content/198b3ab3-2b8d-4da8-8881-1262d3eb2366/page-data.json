It surprised a few people.  Truth be told it didn’t really sink in for me until this week.  I spent the entire week trying to remain composed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why leave?  The exit survey poses that question expectantly.  It’s simple: I’m relocating and circumstances [editor’s note: <em>including</em> but not only my age] made now the right time.  Where to?  Tokyo.  I’ve wanted to do it since 2017, so, you know.  That’s why.  This has been in the works for a  hot minute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week in data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>🥪 Pret eaten: 7 sandwiches</li>\n<li>🚶 People who said they plan to visit Japan next year: 12</li>\n<li>🎬 Movies watched: 6 films</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Between packing and leaving a job.  I began the week with a todo list as long as my arm...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many people reached out to chat.  Some wished me luck.  Some said kind things. All of them — some of whom might be reading this — in reaching out made leaving just that little bit harder.  Thank-you?  But, really.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The most common question I got was “Do you speak any japanese?” to which I answered “少し話せます”, or, a little. The second most common question was “Are you packed yet?” to which I answered “No, but that’s not the problem - it’s getting rid of my furniture and all the other things I’m not packing!”...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I made a lot of headway there though: My wardrobe is now 1/4 its size, many of my kitchen trinkets &#x26; bits of computer/audio hardware now have new homes, and on Wednesday NR bought my air conditioner which I helped deliver to a cavernous townhouse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The biggest hurdle to leaving a job — he says expertly now having only ever done this ceremony twice — is the bit where you have to stand up and say some words.  The leaving speech.  I put together some notes and then my brain spent most of Thursday in “waiting mode\".  Snapshot seemed to be overrunning and then very suddenly it wasn’t, and I was staring at a slide with a massive picture of my face on it.  I Slacked <a href=\"https://alicebartlett.co.uk/\">Alice</a> “AAAAAAAAAAAAAA”.  She said several nice, witty things - raising the bar [for my speech] - and then it was my turn.  It felt like an eternity but by clock-time only a few minutes had passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How often does someone on your blogroll do your leaving speech?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My leaving drinks were at The Shaw’s Booksellers.  I booked space for 25 people and considerably more than 50 showed up, honestly, I felt touched.  It took me two hours to make it past the entrant because the place was so packed.  I’m grateful to everyone who came.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Thanks for lunch, ZA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>My final task on Friday was removing the stickers from my laptop - and I managed to fully remove and clean all but one, a “The W” sticker from Watergate Records.  I left my last <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wecomeinpiecepuzzle\">“We Come In Piece” jigsaw puzzle</a> behind along with a few other things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MT and FS intercepted me leaving the office and dragged me semi-reluctantly for dinner. We picked Franco Manca outside St Pauls — because if I’ve learned one thing, it’s that good pizza is difficult to find in Japan — and we confused the heck out of the staff by asking for extra garlic.  All-in-all, one of the nicest and most memorable meals I’ve had in quite some time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Getting home I gave up on the whole composure thing.  Or it gave up on me.  You’re saying goodbye to quite a lot: There were tears.  I drafted and redrafted a few messages several times, sending some of them, until I was hit in the early hours by a revocation a full day early.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Saturday was the day when I finished packing, interspersed with help cleaning the apartment from LF who is the OG of this story.  Our soundtrack was <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/36P07bti6xD99o7S1acmin\">Brat and it’s completely different but also still brat</a> which made things easier.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We went to Paddington, to meet TM and FS there... We had a quick lunch, a bit of a natter (mine mostly nervous energy) and then I left on the Heathrow express, two suitcases and bag in hand.  Just over an hour later (yes, really) I was at my gate.  Through Heathrow in record time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The plane journey was great.  15 hours, minimal turbulence considering all the storms we flew through.  ANA food slaps.  I was in economy (3-4-3 configuration) and had two empty seats next to me.  I think 11 hours might be my upper limit for flights, because this just felt too long.  I watched six(!) feature-length movies - which is a new record:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1684562\">The Fall Guy (2024)</a> was just heaps of fun. I love it when movies are just about clever enough to parody things that other movies are doing. Solid 4/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17009710\">Anatomy Of A Fall (2023)</a>... IM and CC (hi! can I join your club now?!) gave me quite a bit of grief after I didn’t make it past the first ten minutes last time. So I gave it another go and - yeah it’s alright. It really builds. For me it felt a little slow overall so lost some points, but still a 3.5/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392\">Wonka (2023)</a> had been on my radar for ages, but the film itself seemed to be a random collection of tropes and lore all intent on viciously attacking the continuity of Gene Wilder’s classic performance: 2/5 ...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1517268\">Barbie (2023)</a> was fun. It conveyed some serious messages whilst also being an objectively good film? In particular I enjoyed seeing a good take on the consequences of toxic masculinity on men, however lighthearted the overall framing. 3/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14539740\">Godzilla X Kong: The New Emprie (2024)</a> was my first kaiju movie and I get it now. Some humans run around and do their own thing, but in the grand scheme of things you’re watching massive CGI animals doing their own thing - communicating exclusively through indecipherable grunting.  I was quite tired at the time so this was honestly just a perfect watch.  3.5/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5779228\">Garfield (2024)</a> involved some kind of heist and copious references to classic panels. Fun but I’m not sure who the audience was. Well, I’m sure that I wasn’t it. 2.5/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Saturday day blended into Sunday evening, which is all part of my cunning plan to avoid jet-lag.  We’ll see.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lots of love.  Catch you on the flip-side!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w47-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 47, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 47, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"This was my last week at the FT, something I kept very close to my chest.
