They were fine, but I felt <em>very</em> strange the entire day.  There was a blood-test too.  It didn't help.</li>\n<li>The rest of the week I've been doing their blood-sugar challenges, meaning eating specific foods at specific times and watching the impact on a glucose monitor.  Today that was a breakfast of plain white rice with almond butter.  Was it a weird food combination? Yes.  Was it delicious?  <em>Oh my god</em> yes.</li>\n<li>I messed up and accidentally deleted my Substack account <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/4a1f26b1-6ac4-4300-9867-1265b5946bdb\">and wrote about it here</a>.</li>\n<li>Wednesday meant Pisco-sours: What an excellent cocktail.  Dinner at <a href=\"http://mirafloreslondon.co.uk/\">Miraflores</a>, anybody?</li>\n<li>On Friday I went to Brighton for ffconf, both for the first time.  Brighton is great (the fish &#x26; chips are actually better) and I now totally get why people keep moving there.</li>\n<li>ffconf was a real vibe: The talks were all bangers and I took away lots of ideas &#x26; frameworks for building a better, more-ethical &#x26; <em>more-fun</em> web.  I spent the entire time catching up with FT colleagues old-and-new (we were probably the biggest group there) and slightly regret not meeting anyone new.  But, I don't regret the tacos.</li>\n<li>The train-journey to Brighton had probably the friendliest guard anyone will ever meet.  She gave us slightly misleading advice though, which meant us walking to Brighton from Hove.  The train-journey back was just incredibly wholesome and was a great wrap-up for the day.</li>\n<li>The elephant in the room is running.  It is still happening.  Slowly.  I need to re-gain some fitness.  The last few weeks have been a bit much.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"I'm still doing ZOE tests.
