Some “back-of-napkin” maths for RAG (it’s expensive!), some talking &#x26; goal-setting (seeking approvals!) and some efforts to understand how big this new project I was asked to support is (scarily large!).</li>\n<li>In my notes there’s something in here about a collaboration cafe, but to be honest I don’t really remember what it was themed after.  The company was the main reason I went, and I got to recount some stories that didn't paint me in a positive light but made my friends smile.</li>\n<li>We returned to the Bombay Sizzlers for dishes which were no longer on the menu, and settled for curry instead.  I had the Goan Fish Curry, which is at least as good as <a href=\"https://www.ashasbirmingham.co.uk/\">Asha’s</a> and brings me back: The last time I had it was in Asha's in week 51 of 2018.</li>\n<li>The working week was also positively saturated with end-of-year all-hands events.  It’s kind-of crazy seeing how much stuff was shipped throughout the entire year.</li>\n<li>Made a happy mistake in Shibuya when we went into the wrong place, and instead of delicious yakitori, we had delicious <em>everything-else</em>.  I’m still not sure what the meat soup I had was, but whatever creature it originated from tasted quite good.</li>\n<li>Really sorry CL.</li>\n<li>By some stroke of fate, as I write this, I find myself in Nagoya once again, this time for a business trip.</li>\n<li>We tried Nagoya's proud tradition of <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%A2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B9\">モーニング</a>, and, reader, I am obsessed.  There are at least as many branches of Komeda Coffee as there are people, and yet they are still somehow all busy.  But, the coffee is as rich &#x26; dark as can be, and the toast genuinely made my day.</li>\n<li>“I WANT TO FAIL!” — DS’s award acceptance speech, 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w51-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 51, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 51, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"This week marks the beginning of a busy era.
