Several memorable coffee catch-ups (without incident, this time).  My current side-quest involves one of the less walked (and, documented?) roads of being a senior IC: networking.  More about this another time.</li>\n<li>Nothing too exciting to report.  Got involved in some discussions, and tried to create focus-time to ship something.

It was mostly electronic acts, and it let me finally tick <a href=\"https://theprodigy.com/\"></a>The Prodigy off my bucket list (somehow I missed them completely when I lived in London).  I <em>loved</em> their set.  Many memorable moments.</li>\n<li>I saw... <em>sharp inhale of breath</em> ... <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume_(Japanese_band)\">PERFUME</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2hollis\">2HOLLIS</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyary_Pamyu_Pamyu\">Kyary Pamyu Pamyu</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/floatingpoints\">Floating Points</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/prodigythe\">The Prodigy</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/gesaffelstein\">Gesaffelstein</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/shioriybradshaw\">Shiory Bradshaw</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/minna-no-kimochi\">Minna-no-Kimochi</a>.  All were great performances with high production value, and great energy in the room.  I had major FOMO for the acts I <em>couldn’t</em> see.

Unfortunately this plan did not work out, and I might as well have saved scratch by taking the first-train back and sleeping in my own bed instead.  Oh well, at least I earned some air-miles.</li>\n<li>Understandably the day after was less productive than I expected, but I got through a lot:  I managed to gym, buy some groceries, do some homework, do some laundry, and most excitingly, go on a second haircut.  And I finished watching the first part of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13443470\">Wednesday S02</a>, which is good fun.</li>\n<li>Co-star is great.</li>\n<li>In the evening, I joined a bunch of families at Yotsuya crossing <a href=\"https://www.jinguhanabi.com/\">watching the Meiji Jingu Gaien fireworks</a> which were <em>great</em>.</li>\n<li>Sunday we went to <a href=\"https://mimt.jp/ex/renoir-cezanne/\">Renoit X Cézanne</a> exhibition.  I’m not sure if it was a competition, but I walked out thinking that Renoit was the clear winner.  I’m not sure that there’s consensus.</li>\n<li>Shout out to TC — unprompted — giving me an alternative read on a situation which has connected dots at the cost of confusing me in a brand new way.
