In previous chapters of life I prioritised work above all else and I tied it to my sense of self-worth.  There’s lots to say on that subject, but, not today.  Lessons in-hand, in this chapter I’m now prioritising life too, and am re-learning some things including my self-worth, which is bringing new ups-and-downs.  But I’m enjoying them, a lot.  So, yes, I’ve been distracted.</li>\n<li>My highlight of the week was a team dinner with one of my teams, which we realised was the first time we’d all assembled in person.  We discovered many things including a shared love of Mexican food - which led to a recommendation of <a href=\"https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1303/A130302/13309222/\">3 Hermanos</a> - and to my discovery of a new lunch spot near the office.</li>\n<li>Getting a chance to learn about more advanced framework features in <a href=\"https://rubyonrails.org\">Rails</a> has been fun.  After I clocked out for the week, I connected some dots and realised a mistake in my work which I now get to fix.  It’s been a while since I had a moment like this with a novel tech-stack, so this is refreshing in a good way.</li>\n<li>Careers were a hot topic at dinner this week.  I guess this comes up every summer and every winter.</li>\n<li>Went to the gym nearly every day this week.  When I’m skipping cardio it turns out that 15 minutes is sometimes plenty.  This is a big revelation.  Perhaps not one worthy of this blog.</li>\n<li>Enjoyable side-quest this week: Finding a new home for a colleague’s prized collection of cards.  Much digging and wandering later, I was able to find it a new owner.  And now the three of us are connected.</li>\n<li>Not so enjoyable side-quest involving a very different card, a slack channel and a delivery.</li>\n<li>Late one evening I was summoned using the combination phrase of “FT” and “drinks” and was delighted to see a familiar face on the other end.  We had another Buddhist ceremony.  My calligraphy is getting better, but my ability to spell my own name is not.</li>\n<li>I’m now officially re-enrolled in language class, and we had a mid-week kick-off.  I understood about 80% of our teacher’s self-introduction/自己紹介 which felt like a <em>huge</em> milestone compared to hearing a string of these previously and not understanding any.  Next goal: Crossing the Pareto chasm.</li>\n<li>It’s embargoed for now, so this is mostly a reminder for myself, but I accepted a true Faustian bargain this week.</li>\n<li>Went to the <a href=\"https://www.azabujuban.or.jp/topics/topics_event/22876/\">Azabu-Juban festival</a>, twice, which was a lot of fun.  I’ve gone through many festivals here but this is the first where the energy really grabbed me.</li>\n<li>Checked out the <a href=\"https://biscuitgallery.com/inner-mythology/\">“Inner Mythology”</a> exhibition, which was very intricate and evocative of old world artwork and yet slightly unsettling.  At the same time I saw <a href=\"https://awase-gallery.com/2025/07/23/beyond-the-eyelid-baku-kiyokawa/\">“Beyond the Eyelid”</a> which was powerful.  Both were good fuel for Sunday’s contemplative mood.</li>\n<li>Oh yeah, also some stuff about my kitchen and cooking, but there’s already too many words in this post.</li>\n<li>Considering I live in Tokyo, I hear a <em>lot</em> about Nagoya.  Should I visit?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w34-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 34, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 34, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Lately I’ve been distracted.
