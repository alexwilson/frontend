Some assorted tasks and a real deep-dive into web performance and maps, the latter which I’ve not done much work with before. Managed to get a 75% performance improvement in a crucial area which I’m quite happy with.</li>\n<li>This week in numbers:\n<ul>\n<li>Ebay listings created: 2</li>\n<li>Red-meat consumed: 0 grams</li>\n<li>Headphones thrown away: 1.5 pairs</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Starting to like React Hooks.  Yeah, I’ve not been thrilled at them until now.</li>\n<li>LF and I went to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DBt44ZLoQdB\">Baron’s Bites</a>, which was a League of Legends pop-up/takeover of <a href=\"https://butchies.co.uk/\">Butchies</a>.  Was it worth the twenty-minute queue?  No.  But I got a badge, which I gave away later that same evening.  I paid £11 for their finest plant-based nuggets which started out strong and ended in regret.  The queue seemed friendly.</li>\n<li>The Apple Intelligence update dropped.  Um.  It’s not great, is it?  Here’s a doozy: “Cow sighting; desperate for cow manure”.  Here’s another: “One soup through a straw, deemed suboptimal, but went well without complications”.</li>\n<li>Halloween fell on Thursday and a few people at work dressed up.  I went dressed as myself — scary, I know.  I assumed that nobody would be dressed up on the second floor where I spent the day, but was pleasantly surprised at a convincing Markus Braun getup.  A close second place goes to the white rabbit on three.</li>\n<li>AG and I met up with YS who was in London on holiday, and after a little bit of mulling around and comparing notes on technology, we went to dinner.  I finally got to tick <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/sfrRFz9tmDMEWhjU6\">Chatora City</a> off the list.  Solid meal, all <em>slightly</em> smokey but in a clean, delightfully intentional way.  The spice was a little too much so we drowned our sorrows with mango lassi.</li>\n<li>The dual threat of halloween and MT’s birthday  added up to a Smurf-themed party at the weekend.  For the second time this week I went dressed as myself (why mess with a classic?).  Got there early, and pretty quickly a crowd reminiscent of the blue man group rocked up to The Kernel.  Other groups doing the Bermondsey Beer Mile loved it.  At some point I was anointed with Smurf-cap.</li>\n<li>The Thames Clipper is delightful: Really must take it more often.  Sat down, watching the sunset while drinking a breakfast tea.  Got through a chapter of the Staff Engineer's path.  Maybe good for doing some work while commuting?</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16426418\">Challengers (2024)</a> was a pretty decent tennis movie.  As many characters asked, “Are we talking about Tennis?” No, nothing in the movie the movie has anything to do with tennis, reader, and I don’t know why you’d think that.  A little too long, good soundtrack, 4/5.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188674\">Human Traffic (1999)</a> is fun storytelling applied to a story where, really, nothing happens.  But not in a Seinfeld way — it’s more like the movie equivalent of hanging out in the smoking area all night at a rave.  Incredibly fun cast, <em>great</em> soundtrack, 4.5/5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w44-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 44, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 44, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"Spent a lot of the week helping with various aspects of US election coverage next week.
