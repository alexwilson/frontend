It is one of <em>the</em> most dangerous drinks I have ever tasted.</li>\n<li>On new years day, near a fateful shrine, I shared a cup of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuenyeung\">Coffee Milk Tea</a>, which I’d forgotten was that good. It's pretty easy to make at home with an aeropress don't you know?</li>\n<li>Reader, have you ever built a TV?  I'm building one now as my latest side-project.  There's a lot of moving parts, and it's quite frustrating testing it end-to-end, but I think it'll be worth it for the passive language immersion.</li>\n<li>Before the break, a friend came over for a knife party, in which after sharpening my kitchen knives, we took a whetstone to my brand new pan to try and fix the seasoning.
