Awkwardly specific questions to staff, that’s what. No folks, <a href=\"https://www.abeno.co.uk/\">Abeno</a> don’t do monja. They <strong>do</strong> do great highballs though.</li>\n<li>In a world of component libraries, what even is a design system?</li>\n<li>Caught up with OB at the Euston Tap, and immediately we made a mistake by going for a La Chouffe. Not designed for a pint-glass.</li>\n<li>Picked up a new <a href=\"https://store.hermanmiller.com/home-desk-accessories/oripura-laptop-stand/2532890.html\">fold-flat laptop stand from Colebrook Boston Saunders</a> which pairs great with the ThinkPad Bluetooth keyboard. Game-changer for being able to work in weird places. Looks good too.</li>\n<li>Saturday I threw a birthday shindig starting in Spitalfields and ending in the Blind Beggar with some of my favourite people. You know who you are, thanks for coming!</li>\n<li>The joy of living in South West London is not visiting any other parts of South West London because the transport links are pants, so on Sunday I found <a href=\"https://nickramsbottom.com/\">Nick</a> in a pub in Tooting, and joined a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/11450278100\">capital ring walking group heading to Crystal Palace</a>.</li>\n<li>Also I totally called the Usyk v. Tyson fight, down to the exact result - just like with Eurovision last week.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"What happens when a bunch of Japanophiles, most of whom have lived or stayed in Japan for longer than a holiday, go to the best Okonomiyaki…"},"slug":"/content/c96ebdb3-5f73-4cc8-8ea0-6bdec2a0c6cc"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"c96ebdb3-5f73-4cc8-8ea0-6bdec2a0c6cc"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","955950066"],"slicesMap":{}}
