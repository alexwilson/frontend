Folks, it was only a matter of time: I spilled some coffee onto a keyboard and needed something non-conductive to clean with.  The keyboard hasn't been the same since.</li>\n<li>I'm a <a href=\"https://logseq.com/\">Logseq</a> person now.  <em>I think</em>.  It's another one of these knowledge-management tools (like Obsidian), including the cute little graph, but what's drew me is that it's block-based and driven by daily journals.  I try to write notes as I go - either in Notion or on pen &#x26; paper (❤️ BuJo) - so this fits my style perfectly.  Giving it a proper go.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codebar.io/workshops/2630\">The FT hosted Codebar on Wednesday</a>.  I signed up, either to speak or coach, and falling through the admin gaps ended up doing neither.  I hung out with our recruiters instead and chatted to a few people about working at the pink newspaper.  Turnout was great, and the sheer variety of different projects and ideas the students brought with them was huge in a way I can only describe as energising.  To be that creative once more.</li>\n<li>Finished reading <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43889703\">The Man Who Solved The Market</a> which was the story of how quantitative trading came to be — against all odds — and the messy interplay of the people involved.  It sadly also includes a story around right-wing political funding and how that sowed division.  I'd like to read books without encountering the words \"Cambridge Analytica\".  One day.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chk18ORGM9A\">Katana Hero</a> was great.  They were going for a cheesy vibe and they got it.  Smiled start to finish.</li>\n<li>Watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16428256/\">Suzume</a> on Sunday.  The plot was very cute and featured lots of realistic travel around Japan, the door-lore from Monster's Inc. and TF2 prop-hunt.  The art was gorgeous: At times it felt more like looking at a piece of art than watching a movie.  Followed by dinner at <a href=\"https://www.dishoom.com/\">Dishoom</a> which was lovely but expensive.</li>\n<li>Twitter webmentions are down, maybe forever.  I've been meaning to switch likes and reposts out for something like <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/clap\">claps</a> - this might be the impetus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w15.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 15, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"This was a short week, but it didn't feel like a short week.
