No, reader, they all went swimmingly well.  I’m genuinely pleasantly surprised.</li>\n<li>I got here in a van: Despite having multiple train lines from Birmingham to London, it’s somehow still quicker to drive from my flat in London to my parents home in Birmingham. Or at least, it should have been: It took <em>nearly 30 minutes</em> to drive down Putney High Street alone.  Sheesh.</li>\n<li>Bluesky is really popping off huh.</li>\n<li>L helped me with some more chores. Later we played some music, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/2024-11-17-set\">first semi-seriously</a> and later after giving up <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/genresweep-afterparty-2\">just committed some crimes</a> with my apparently now <em>broken</em> mixer.</li>\n<li>Despite the (painful, at least to me) mistakes that was still a pretty technically advanced set and I'm pretty proud of how far I've come since picking DJing back up in 2020. It's such a fun hobby. And it's a very different, really intimate — and almost <em>therapeutic</em> — relationship with music. I genuinely regret not having made more of an effort to play gigs like stormhaven or the MC festival.  Oh well.</li>\n<li>MT, JV and I had a late lunch and another short go at vedremos. It didn’t go well.</li>\n<li>Had the best fish &#x26; chips in AGES from <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/tried-birminghams-best-fish-chip-26028326\">Dads Lane Fish Bar</a>. So good I’m still reeling.  (sorry)</li>\n<li>I’ve been learning about IMAP.  Why?  I have this ambitious plan to replace several apps I use with my email client.  It’s a nice protocol.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2568862\">Going in Style (2017)</a> is a fun little heist movie featuring one of the best dynamics in film: Caine &#x26; Freeman.  I really enjoyed it.  Did you know Zach Braff is a director now?  3/5</li>\n<li>Anyone want a coffee machine that is overdue a descale?</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Hello from sunny Birmingham.
