I've pared back the scope to just enabling deployments, and am trying to be as unopinionated as possible about what is actually deployed, because research has proven that opinions are a big ongoing investment.  In the coming weeks the new team (which also gathered for the first time this week) breaks ground, but we need to better socialise this first.</li>\n<li>Elections are now also officially kicked-off.  Lots to do, not much time to do it in.  Busy, busy.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately this week's efforts in machine-learning land were not that successful: The good news is that models are running, the bad news is that in AWS-land it's pretty boilerplate-intensive to train (or fine-tune) a model.</li>\n<li>One fun distraction, was stumbling upon a critical security vulnerability affecting several of my older projects and I got in touch with my old teams to help them mitigate the immediate problem.</li>\n<li>After weeks waiting on bated breath, I got the long-awaited call from St Thomas's - I seem to have successfully made it into the 70% of cases making a recovery.  What that means is I can stop taking blood thinners, and that travel is fully back on the table, (and if you're reading this and you're my line manager, that means a holiday request heading your way soon™).</li>\n<li>But I don't <em>feel</em> recovered yet.  Now begins the long journey back to regaining the fitness I lost.  There's something else I need to get checked out, and after the near miss in January, I don't trust my GP.</li>\n<li>God I need a hair-cut.</li>\n<li>Wednesday marked a dinner at <a href=\"https://www.masalazone.com/locations/piccadilly-circus/\">Masala Zone</a> in Piccadilly Circus, with my new favourite crowd.  Tasty, and surprisingly affordable for a location that good.  A well-known UK PM, a train-fare-dodger?  In this economy?  That's what I heard.</li>\n<li>And on Sunday, I had a late lunch with Lucy in Spitalfields, and a long walk around London plotting holiday travel.  I've missed it: The excitement of all the things you could do, before they're tempered by the reality of time constraints and wallets.</li>\n<li>Did Netlify just lay-off all of the Gatsby team?  That might be the final straw I've needed to move this blog to something simpler, or more home-grown.</li>\n<li>F﻿ootball was OK.  Sad to see England lose, but Spain just played better.</li>\n<li>Everybody was right: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/\">The Bear</a> is phenomenal, stunning and beautiful.  I've been obsessed by professional kitchens ever since <a href=\"https://ridley.co/\">Mark</a> pointed me to how they're a great example of team-work.  The energy is palpable, and right after being exhausted by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26230386/\">Fishes</a>, I was blown away by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26230388/\">Forks</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w33.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 33, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 33, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"This week's big theme at work was architecture and planning for Extensible Frontends: I've arrived at what seems like a reasonable proposal…"},"slug":"/content/cfd56234-9e54-4487-b917-aef18c059537"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"cfd56234-9e54-4487-b917-aef18c059537"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","955950066"],"slicesMap":{}}
