But the four day long weekend is worth celebrating in its own right. Why don’t we have more of these?</li>\n<li>On Wednesday I went to a sake-tasting by <a href=\"https://www.takarashuzo.co.jp/english/\">Takara brewery</a>, where after a brief lecture on the production &#x26; grading of sake, we got to try four pretty different varieties. I’d never had sparkling sake before and, considering how cheap it is, it’s delicious. Move on over champagne.</li>\n<li>Also on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://jakechampion.name/\">Jake</a> left the FT (and I gave him the best leaving gift I’ll probably ever give). I’ll miss you Jake, really.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule\">Some interesting conversations came up during Jake’s leaving drinks</a>, but one that stuck with me was actually about weeknotes. Our most “liked” notes are ones sprinkled with tragedy and negativity. What gives, people? You’re sending some really strange messages!</li>\n<li>On Friday I went into central, central London to watch <a href=\"https://m.imdb.com/title/tt8115900/\">Bad Guys</a> with <a href=\"https://laura.monster/\">Laura</a>. Nobody is wearing masks anymore - but thankfully it’s such an unpopular movie that we had the theatre to ourselves. The movie was - uncomfortable, but fine.</li>\n<li>For the first time since last July, with minimal prep &#x26; planning, <a href=\"https://m.soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/2022-04-17-set\">I played some techno. I made a few mistakes, but overall IMO it’s pretty dope and I hope you enjoy it</a>. There’s a reason they don’t let me play Psy.</li>\n<li>I wrote a difficult email about migrating users away from my Google Workspace domain. For over a decade it’s been free, but Google are discontinuing access. We talk about <a href=\"https://killedbygoogle.com/\">how many products they kill</a> but, well, they’re doing quite well financially so maybe they’re onto something.</li>\n<li>Remember I <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/7c53951b-0a82-4e61-b704-23b4b79adcf2\">talked about reading Russian tweets</a>? Turns out you can do that with Japanese tweets too - and <a href=\"https://github.com/mirigana/mirigana\">Mirigana</a> can help.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"I didn’t do anything for lent this year.
