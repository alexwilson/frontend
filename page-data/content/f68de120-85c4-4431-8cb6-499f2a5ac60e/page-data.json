However after a self-inflicted nudge, I have now set my top-priority.</li>\n<li>For some system design, I learned a lot about how public holidays and time-off legally work in Japan. In short there are three-(ish) separate bodies of legislation which each do a different thing and name different days, but come together to give us weekends and bank holidays.  Although, interestingly, unless you’re a bank, none of these days is actually guaranteed.</li>\n<li>My birthday gift game is getting better.</li>\n<li>Over a delicious chicken lunch, I'm loaned some house-keys with a fob-attached AirTag. I know that the AirTag is there, obviously, but this is a rare opportunity to see how long it really takes for an phone to notice.  How long did it take my phone?  6+ hours.
