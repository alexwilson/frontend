Maybe the routine got me somewhere. Maybe it’s just the jet lag having worn off. Maybe it’s the nature of the life-admin changing. Maybe it’s something else entirely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week in data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>📼 Training videos watched: 5 hours</li>\n<li>🌯 Team lunches: 3</li>\n<li>🍵 Oi Ocha consumed: 3.5 litres</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Felt my first earthquake in yonks <a href=\"https://www.data.jma.go.jp/multi/quake/quake_detail.html?eventID=20241204191551&#x26;lang=jp\">on Tuesday evening</a>. It’s been a while (maybe 5 years?) so I’d forgotten how it feels. Intensity 1 so nobody else was even remotely fussed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This was my first week at work, and I’m feeling the same sense of awe and wonder one does exploring any new world. I’m pretty excited!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Part of onboarding, or, I guess, being in a large company is needing an evergreen way of introducing yourself - and so one of my tasks involved writing a page about myself for an internal documentation hub.  (It also includes a link to the about me page on this blog, which, is somewhat out of date - sorry!)  It’s kind-of great, and reading others I realised that there’s lots to strike up conversations about.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is not only Mapo Tofu but an entire Mapo Tofu set-meal in a restaurant in the building. This is not a drill people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I have a bank card now! It supports one of the major Japanese banking protocols so in theory a whole new world of payment options has now opened up. It meant scheduling a registered letter to be delivered during a specific 2hr time-slot, and just when I was about to give up as the slot was nearly over, I saw a postie cycling up to outside my building.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>React 19 is out and somehow that has resulted in yet more breakages in the builds of this blog.  Very annoying.  I really want a more reliable blogging platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally used the “delivery boxes” downstairs to receive an Amazon package. There’s an interface in my building with a very primitive, late '90s UI backed with a resistive touchscreen.  It’s like having an Amazon locker in your building: you put in your door number, a secret passcode, and any eligible boxes swing open.  Pretty slick.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I swung by Yoyogi park to check out the <a href=\"https://philippinefestivaljp.com/\">Philippine Festival</a> which looked like heaps of fun - lots of singing and drinking and an atmosphere which made me want to visit the Philippines. I hadn’t had Filipino cuisine before so tried a plate of Pancit Palabok which was OK.  Saw <a href=\"https://en.japantravel.com/tokyo/shibuya-blue-cave-illumination/33121\">Blue Light cave</a> on the way back which was so blue that all of my photos have an alien glow to them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sunday <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/13070017406\">I hiked up Mount Takao</a> to catch the last of the autumn foliage, and the views definitely delivered. Parts of the hike were very difficult because there were some steep inclines - but I managed to do it a bit faster than my last attempt last year. It’s a nice route so I may try it more often, but the weather is getting a bit colder now...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Big item coming up next on the docket: Where the heck do you find proper house-cleaning supplies?  I can’t find anything in the supermarkets I’ve tried, and all I can find in convenience stores is generic cleaning sprays.  I’m missing something big - I can tell.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brown Bear says hi.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w49-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 49, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 49, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"This week felt considerably more normal than last week.
