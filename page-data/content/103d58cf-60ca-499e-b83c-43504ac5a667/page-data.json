It's freezing, but despite the temperature it doesn't feel cold.  Maybe it was the dancing.  Another sip of champagne.  Rick Astley begins singing on the TV inside.  This time feels different.</li>\n<li>New Year's Day falling on a Monday stretched out my holiday break to include the entire first week of the year, a first - excuse the pun, which gave me some time to catch-up with people and with my reading list.  Is 40 books doable this year?</li>\n<li><em>Oh, he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGxIE1hr0w4\">rickrolled</a> us</em>.</li>\n<li>This week also brought coursework, so much of it that some of my upcoming evenings will continue to be consigned to it.

And yet something felt very off: I feel like I learned something, but, I don't know what.</li>\n<li>Motivated by breaking the streak, and a rough December, this year I aim to experiment a bit more with the format of these notes.  Likely many will still be weekly, but I'd quite like to group intervals thematically when it makes sense to.  It fits the journalling format better: Some things are (small) chapters.</li>\n<li>I'm so very close to installing conventional blogging software out of frustration.
