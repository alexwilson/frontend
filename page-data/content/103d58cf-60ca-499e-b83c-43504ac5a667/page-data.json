This time feels different.</li>\n<li>New Year's Day falling on a Monday stretched out my holiday break to include the entire first week of the year, a first - excuse the pun, which gave me some time to catch-up with people and with my reading list.

Likely many will still be weekly, but I'd quite like to group intervals thematically when it makes sense to.  It fits the journalling format better: Some things are (small) chapters.</li>\n<li>I'm so very close to installing conventional blogging software out of frustration.
