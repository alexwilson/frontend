There’s nothing like a month on a futon (on a laminate wooden floor) to help you appreciate the wonders of a firm mattress.  And having a sofa is game-changing: Now I can drink coffee.</li>\n<li>Got a nice shout-out in the departmental all-hands (thank-you!). Also an announcement about the formation of a new central team, which I’m joining part-time and am pretty chuffed about.</li>\n<li>It’s H1 performance review season.  Which, for me, is a great time to reflect on this whole being-an-IC-again thing.  Mirroring my time as an EM, separating the two roles is difficult: I find it far too easy to call on my EM tool-kit in some situations.  But no regrets so far: We trust in the great IC-EM pendulum.</li>\n<li>Thursday and Friday evenings were spent hanging out until the wee hours.  Thursday I split a cab, and Friday I walked home: my new address is already paying off big time.</li>\n<li>Very glad to see a few people I hadn’t seen in yonks (esp. CL!) and to make some new friends.  Sad about one of the recurring topics.</li>\n<li>Paid my first set of bills.  This normally wouldn’t be note-worthy, but, one involved paying actual cash with a printed receipt at a convenience store.  Seconds after I’d handed over the cash, I got an automated payment receipt <em>email</em>. Someone explain this technological juxtaposition, please?!</li>\n<li>Saturday I was drawn by the promise of Drum-n-Bass to a night market pop-up in the permanent liminal space that is that long street next to Yoyogi park.  Very good energy, shame about the weather.</li>\n<li>Around 5PM in a coffee shop, someone came in and sat down with an iced latte.  They put the drink down and went into the smoking room.  Then they returned and took a sip.  Immediately back to the smoking room.  They returned, another swig, and then back, again, to the smoking room.  Then they abruptly left: It’s at this point I noticed their bag - a record bag on wheels.  Rough night ahead.</li>\n<li>Starting to really miss DJ-ing.  There’ve been moments where I gaze wistfully at my Bandcamp library and wonder what could’ve been.</li>\n<li>Probably for the best I didn’t become a modular synth person, eh?  <em>No Alex don’t even joke about it.</em></li>\n<li>Rainy season is around the corner.  Time to buy an umbrella?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w21-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 21, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 21, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Hello, it is me, the floating head of Jor-El.
