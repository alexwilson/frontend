There are a lot of APIs in my new jurisdiction, and to deliver the best possible platform experience, we first need a map of what they do and what they don’t.

No.  I <em>need</em> to model everything - in work and in life - in graphs.  Just one more node.  That’s all I need.  I can stop any time.</li>\n<li>According to my notes, “Got some stuff into production”, so, that?</li>\n<li>Over the week and weekend, I went through a series of McKinsey courses on topics ranging from resilience, communication and problem-solving*.  Some of the content was basic, but for every topic there was at least one practical tool, framework or technique.  There were lots of exercises including two pieces of case-work.  Doing this course coincided with being in an oddly contemplative mood, which gave me the chance to retrospect.  I actually enjoyed it.</li>\n<li>The Yotsuya crew assembled in Nonki to deliver a timeshare pitch to one of many.  First order was quail eggs.  I think we succeeded?  Not a bad start to the week.</li>\n<li>Welcoming our new graduates, my department threw a small party this week: It, I hope, is the only time I will ever see both Sashimi and Fish &#x26; Chips served at the same time.</li>\n<li>There’s a Mexican restaurant I used to walk past every day. This week we went there.  It slapped, and was fairly affordable.  I got to big-up London, present my Unified Supermarket Theory and share a Google Doc which says <a href=\"https://maps.app.goo.gl/ijucaim1FerBxqCX6\">where to find good coffee</a>.</li>\n<li>My other win this week was replacing my air conditioner: The previous one was old enough to vote in most countries, and in some to drink.  From its regular aches and groans this information would not surprise you.  The new one is whisper quiet, and I’m hoping is equally light on the ‘leccy bill.</li>\n<li>Closing the week I am summoned to deepest darkest Kanda for curry.  This wasn’t the fanciest meal of the week, but it was the best.  It’s cash only and <em>of course</em> I’ve only just gone and spent the last of my cash.
