Let’s cut straight to the chase so you can close this tab and get back to doomscrolling: the answer is <strong>no</strong>.  I considered getting the <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/things-to-do/whats-the-deal-with-kfc-and-christmas-in-japan\">“Party Barrel”</a> but — for the price it seemed like <em>horrible</em> value (as well as a <em>lot</em> of food) so I let it sell out.  Instead I picked up some Family Mart &#x26; Lawson fried chicken on the day, since they were still discounted but could come in <em>much</em> smaller servings and I had that instead.  It was OK, and the roast chicken was borderline good (and not on KFC’s menu) but the fried chicken is - just that - fried chicken.

I tried to listen to King’s College Chapel service about some number of carols and lessons — but it’s locked-up, gated and paywalled in so many ways outside of the UK that calling it a <em>religious</em> ceremony seems <em>slightly</em> inaccurate?  First year without hearing “Once in Royal David's City”. :^(</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The day itself was a work-day, I brought in some fancy biscuits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There's Christmas music [editor's note: no longer <em>only</em> WHAM!, but mostly still WHAM!], there's pretty lights and there's beautiful Christmas trees. But there isn't really the atmosphere. Which makes sense — solstice is celebrated another way, New Years is the family gathering and only roughly 1% of the population are Christian.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Christmas Eve my plans changed and I had to be near home to pick up a package (originally they involved going to a party) — but this worked out in my favour <em>because</em> it turns out that the office is a prime viewing spot for the <a href=\"https://www.tokyo-odaiba.net/en/rainbow2024/\">Odaiba Rainbow Fireworks</a>.  They were <em>stunning</em>.  Unfortunately I couldn't get any better photos.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Joined the biweekly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6lkky\">Mölkky</a> group after work, and played a few games.  I’m not saying that I’m good at Mölkky (3/5 of my throws were bad throws) but of the three rounds of “best of three” match-ups, my team won each time.  In all seriousness though, it’s lots of fun!  Balancing strategic throws against a stick which <em>could</em> just bounce the wrong direction builds a kind of suspense I wasn’t expecting from a low-impact sport.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experienced the Japanese hospital system for the first time for a routine outpatients thing, and all I can really say about it — having only <em>really</em> dealt with the British healthcare system before — is that it felt incredibly dignified.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Every year I speed-run Metroid fusion around christmas day. I don’t know why, it’s a strange little tradition I accidentally invented sometime in my early teens. Anyway this year playing the Japanese copy of Fusion I got last week, I managed a PB.  I'm putting it down to slightly better routing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I dabbled around a few stories (ok, a large portion of it was donki) looking for christmas gifts.  Disappointingly most of them are KitKats.  But not all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I also looked for cards, and bought a bunch without checking what they were — it turns out that instead of being thick because they conatined card stock, they were thick because they were small multi-packs (3) of envelopes.  So now I have a lot.  Anyone want an impeccably decorated New Years ~card~ <em>envelope</em>?  (I couldn't find a single, non-Disney-branded Christmas card)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week sort-of closes with boarding a plane for my admin-and-new-years-trip back to the UK.  It isn’t <em>very</em> clear but during the first leg of the flight we flew over Mount Fuji.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hong Kong International’s terminal is unfathomably huge - and so there were moments where I genuinely felt lost, but: There’s a mini-<a href=\"https://guide.michelin.com/gb/en/hong-kong-region/hong-kong/restaurant/duddell-s\">Duddells</a> in there meaning Michelin-star roast duck before your flight and it can’t get any better than that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>PS can I just point out that this is the first year where I didn't miss a week? Even though I said I would. Being more gentle with the editing cycle, and keeping a running notes doc in \"iA Writer\" makes this all a bit easier.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w52-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 52, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 52, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"Oh gosh OK there’s quite a lot to get through.
