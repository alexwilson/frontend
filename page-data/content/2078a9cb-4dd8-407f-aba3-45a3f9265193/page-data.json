Two weeks flew by! 😬</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Monday I took the day off work, barely met said deadlines and successfully didn’t cry. Now the term is finally over, to make time for travel &#x26; for other hobbies/learning, I’ve dialled back my class-load next term.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/Kree\">Kree!</a> Between the cracks I began watching Stargate SG-1. It’s been over a decade since I saw this show. It hasn’t aged well, but the nostalgia is wonderfully distracting.</li>\n<li>With the weather improving, I’ve been going on long walks around Putney/Roehampton/Wimbledon. Between the dreary winter lockdown &#x26; finals season I’ve been quite sedentary (gaining a few pounds) so long walks through greenery &#x26; woods in the sun are a <em>major</em> step-change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For part of said coursework I had to programmatically detect beats in music.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I didn’t need a high level of detail detail, so did the analysis mostly on the fly using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform\">Fast Fourier Transform</a>. These transforms make working with complex signal-based data, like music, in the far simpler frequency domain. For every playable moment of the song, you get amplitude numbers. ( <code class=\"language-text\">Observable&lt;Array&lt;Array&lt;Number>>></code>)</li>\n<li>Averaging these numbers gives the current “energy” of the song.  Storing that in a buffer lets you to record “energy” over time.  By counting when the \"energy\" jumps, you find beats!  There’s a bit more to it, and loads of nuance in tuning this algorithm which <a href=\"http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/programming/features/beatdetection/\">is explained in a good article on gamedev</a>.</li>\n<li>Crossing the streams rocks: My hobbyist knowledge of music production really helped - and it’s quite nice branching out into a new area of technology. Maybe a future write-up?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This week I <em>wasn’t</em> accepted into a work-sponsored programme to learn Japanese.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning Japanese (<em>to the point where I might relocate</em>) has been a major personal goal since briefly working there in 2018, although <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/20bf537b-e7c7-45f5-be35-35f3e1b2b586#:~:text=think%20that%20trying,at%20a%20time.\">without meaningful progress since 2019</a>. The application process stirred up a lot of old feelings by making my goal seem — attainable. Unsurprisingly I was disappointed to be rejected, but, it’s reminded me of how important this goal is to me: <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it_is_what_it_is\">каквото, такова</a> / <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it_can%27t_be_helped\">しょうがない</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mattandre.ws/\">Matt</a> brought me to a Japanese-speaking meetup on Thursday. With many in the room being at N3 level or above, I felt really out of my depth &#x26; so I left after an hour. However: Seeing &#x26; hearing spoken Japanese (and textbooks!) made the goal feel real &#x26; attainable again, so once I can confidently say more than “I don’t speak Japanese” I’ll be going back.</li>\n<li>Now I’m exploring my options to compile a rough learning plan. Some have suggested that UoL (SOAS &#x26; UCL) might be the best class-based options in London, supplemented with independent revision &#x26; meetups — but — if you have suggestions or opinions on how best to learn Japanese I would love to hear from you.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"With a few coursework deadlines this week, last week I skipped both journalling & writing weeknotes.
