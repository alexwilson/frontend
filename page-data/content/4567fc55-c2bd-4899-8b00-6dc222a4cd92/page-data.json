There’s two parts.  First up, a timed, multiple-choice section.  Followed by a written-paper to finish within 24 hours.</li>\n<li>24 hours, after you account for for sleep, work — oh and that timed multiple-choice section — <em>really</em> means ~6hrs.  With both papers it didn’t feel like enough.</li>\n<li>Here’s a hot tip: If you know you’ve got exams coming up: Just, just take some time off, ok?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As well as exams there’s also been a coursework element.  Between the two though I’ve been spending a lot of time at home.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having something to occupy my mind has been handy for avoiding, you know, everything.</li>\n<li>Writing code &#x26; reports following formats &#x26; conventions that are so far removed from industry best practice &#x26; my own skills, is really difficult.  Like, for one thing I can’t use <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/shows/ttt/series-2/es2015#favorite_es2015_features\">features added to the JavaScript language in 2015</a>.</li>\n<li>On the flip-side, I’ve now built a music visualiser which (I think) is pretty dope.  At some point I’ll rewrite that thing, add some streaming-service integrations and open-source it.  (Sadly not quite winAMP cool)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Smoked salmon over rice, that’s all I’m saying.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First you make some rice.</li>\n<li>Then you lay some smoked salmon over it.</li>\n<li>Vegetables optional.  (And better on the side)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This week I’ve also been preoccupied (over)-rethinking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexWilsonV1/status/1502066509010673670\">some career goals</a> as well as quietly worrying about a medical thing, but honestly the whole salmon-over-rice thing is both more interesting and better formed.  Have a great one!</em></p>","excerpt":"As of this week we’re in finals season, so during the week I sat two maths exams remotely. How do remote exams work?
