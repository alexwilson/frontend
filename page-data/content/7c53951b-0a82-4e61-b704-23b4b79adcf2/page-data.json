That crept up quickly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of my spare time this month went towards ... mid-terms and <em>recovering from</em> mid-terms.  Tight deadlines are one thing: Vague rubrics that surprise you with nuance are another.</li>\n<li>Neither published yet but I also managed to write some software (in Swift) and some words (in plain English).  Both activities feel novel and rewarding.</li>\n<li>At the start of the month I joined a new team at work, which (amongst many other things) has involved learning about different domains, meeting new people and becoming ever-so-slightly overwhelmed at the new number of things going on.  It’s pretty great!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/20bf537b-e7c7-45f5-be35-35f3e1b2b586\">my review of 2021</a> I wrote about not trying to languages without enrolling in a school (for accountability &#x26; realism).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Well, life’s full of surprises and something totally unexpected happened: My regular scheduled programme of doom-scrolling through Twitter was interrupted by The Algorithm recommending Tweets in Russian.  Like, technologist humor and general slice-of-life content.</li>\n<li>And I understood enough of it (save for the occasional word and/or grammatical aberration) that I’ve now begun reading some short-form in Russian.  Less combining individual letters and more scanning words.  Neat.</li>\n<li>Honestly just wanted to tell someone about this because it feels like a switch has finally been flipped in my brain: Although the real lesson here is that Twitter’s algorithm is becoming increasingly creepy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the chess front I’ve been trying to do a bit of a deep-dive in learning <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/openings/London-System\">The London System</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, fine, sure, it’s a meme, whatever you say dude.  I like it a lot because it’s a <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31235838-the-agile-london-system\"><em>remarkably</em> well documented</a> beginner-friendly opening with logical variations.</li>\n<li>Learning variations is <em>hard</em>. It requires more concentration than actually playing a game of chess and annoyingly it’s additive: Understanding every step of how you arrive at a position is core to understanding what you do next.  If one of those pieces isn’t quite there, things get really difficult really quickly.  If there’s a better way I’m all ears!</li>\n<li>So far my progress is hard to measure.  Against bots (<em>humans are scary!</em>) I’m usually interrupted before I can commit to a meaningful variation.  Grr.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"January’s nearly over.  That crept up quickly.
