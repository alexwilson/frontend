There‚Äôs nothing too interesting for me to say about it but it felt noteworthy at the time.  Some tourists might‚Äôve been impressed, but living here I‚Äôve lost that magic.</li>\n<li>This week in numbers:\n<ul>\n<li>üï∏Ô∏è Domains purchased: 2</li>\n<li>üìû Phone-calls: 22</li>\n<li>üç≤ Soup consumed: 2.2L</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Had a few conversations this week which I <em>really</em> enjoyed.  I mixed a few different tools/techniques which let me keep them short and structured: Think coaching blended with the 5-whys.</li>\n<li>On my backburner is the general problem of, ‚ÄúHow to orchestrate/instrument R?‚Äù.  The closest I‚Äôve come is the <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openmetrics/index.html\">openmetrics</a> library, but what I really want is to see where a pipeline might be failing.</li>\n<li>If you‚Äôre ever wondering if you should sort your data client-side or server-side, the answer is: both!  A comparison sort (A>B, or: <code class=\"language-text\">Array.sort((a,b) => (a-b))</code>) has linear complexity so is cheap to run client-side if data is already sorted, and it‚Äôs a good defence mechanism.  But server-side is always cheaper for users.  If your sorting rules are complex then add a numeric points-based score server-side, maybe even in your data model.  You‚Äôre welcome.</li>\n<li>Giving feedback to people who don‚Äôt have to listen is hard and is something I have definitely not mastered. Any tips &#x26; tricks are welcome, reader.</li>\n<li>Played chess with some people from The Guardian. One of the things about working at a newspaper is that many problems are shared and it‚Äôs always nice to hear how others are doing. I didn‚Äôt win a single game. :(</li>\n<li>Went to Snappy Snaps for the first time ever, for some passport photos.  It took seconds.  After I left I realised I‚Äôd made a mistake with the order, and seconds after going in they made it right by reprinting.  Genuinely a delight.  For those thinking that the robots got us beat: I‚Äôve never thanked a photo booth before - this was great and only a hair more expensive.</li>\n<li>Turns out that I <em>really</em> like The Bolter.  It‚Äôs the first City of London pub which consistently does good pours, has a selection of drinks that I actually enjoy and is reasonably priced.  Went last week for the first time, this week for the second.</li>\n<li>My arms have been bruised all week spurring much conversation. Nearly healed now. Had another blood test this weekend (all clear) - this time without bruising.</li>\n<li>Picked up <a href=\"https://www.igdb.com/games/carrion\">Carrion</a> after seeing it mentioned on social media, and beat it over the weekend: Fun little Metroidvania game where you play as an amorphous cosmic horror and navigate a lab to (like in nearly every other metroidvania game) escape. Solid 3.5/5, and the DLC was a great warmdown.</li>\n<li>And finally watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/\">The Batman (2022)</a> which honestly felt slow and I struggled to stay interested.  I wonder if the Batman universe is forever doomed by directors trying to make films as dark and edgy as Christopher Nolan?  This tried too hard.  I gave it 2.5.  The internet disagrees.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Saw the king‚Äôs official transport going through the City of London again.
