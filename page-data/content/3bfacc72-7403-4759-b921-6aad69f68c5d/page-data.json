Spent some time doing a rewrite of a document about ES.</li>\n<li>This week in numbers:\n<ul>\n<li>üöó Miles in a car: 347</li>\n<li>üï∫ Steps taken on a dance-floor: 64153</li>\n<li>üèñÔ∏è Beaches seen: 1</li>\n<li>üé∂ Highest BPM: 200</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Monday marked MT‚Äôs last day at the FT. :(</li>\n<li>Wednesday evening I was joined by M on a mission to buy PJs (thx Uniqlo) followed by dinner and a slow walk up to Guy Ritchie‚Äôs pub (which gave major old-man boozer vibes).</li>\n<li>Thursday I left the house (after a last-minute assignment/call), and went to Paddington station via The Cockpit.  Why?  Meeting LF to catch a train to Reading.  Why?  Road-trip from there to Skegness in the morning.  We met up with JL and grabbed a ‚Äòspoons dinner and siren chaser.</li>\n<li>Friday we drove up to Skegness, picking up a McDs brekkie and LM on the way. There was a playlist and to say it had range is an understatement. Service-station KFC lunch. At some point we crossed over into farmer territory‚Ñ¢ (as defined by: more tractors than cars). Pulled into Butlins, checked in, settled in, etc.</li>\n<li>BK dinner, completing the trinity: Today was rock-bottom for the old diet.</li>\n<li>We went to Skegness for <a href=\"https://bangface.com/\">Bangface</a>, a yearly coming-together of all fringes of the electronic music scene. This year‚Äôs theme was Myths &#x26; Legends and the opening ceremony included a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27706924/\">Gladiators</a> bit, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aghuSs8_7Xg\">a massive trojan horse</a> and inflatables.</li>\n<li>Trying to recount the entire thing is a bit pointless because this is one of those events where you‚Äôre in an alternative universe on-site. The pumpkin patch was very cute. The on-site hermes deliveries were hilarious. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8RP1YrTu7RM\">BangEnders</a> was great. We skipped out on the afters, the cooking competition and the Sunday roast - but maybe next time I‚Äôll check out all three.</li>\n<li>Being set in a Butlins made for a very different kind of experience. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about mobile phone battery <em>at all</em>, and staying clean/showering was about as easy as it could be.</li>\n<li>JL made it onto Bangface TV for a competition and won the coveted ‚ÄúCertified Crisp Shagger‚Äù award which included a trophy, a poster, a special hat and a swig of Buckfast.</li>\n<li>I learned a new technique for drinking VK by applying the soju tornado technique. Reader: I do <em>not</em> recommend doing this.</li>\n<li>Given the incredibly high bar at the event it was rather hard to pick, but my favourite sets were by <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/helenahauff\">Helena Hauff</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/ceephaxacidcrew\">Ceephax Acid Crew</a>, <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/hellfish\">Hellfish</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lootcanal\">Lootcanal</a> and [[IVY]](<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ivywubs\">https://soundcloud.com/ivywubs</a>).</li>\n<li><em>It's duolingo on the dancefloor, but you better not kill the streak...</em></li>\n<li>Also ticked <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/fracusanddarwin\">Fracus &#x26; Darwin</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/evolutionrecords\">Scott Brown</a> and <a href=\"https://ra.co/dj/hellfish\">Hellfish</a> off the old bucket-list* while I was there. I listened to these three in my early teens, so all of this stuff hit my emotions - in particular Scott Brown‚Äôs set.</li>\n<li>*Yes, there is a real list, and now I‚Äôve made decent progress with it, I may actually publish it.</li>\n<li>Closing ceremony on Sunday night was awesome. I‚Äôd never heard a St Acid set before, and this one came with <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g9iU73c6vEU\">all the trimmings!</a></li>\n<li>Thanks to having a nearly full phone battery, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18033129194049849\">I managed to get clips of nearly everything I saw in a Reel</a> ‚Äî I want to do a supercut with <em>all</em> the footage because there's much more but it's too much work for now.</li>\n<li><em>You‚Äôre so STYYYLISH</em>.</li>\n<li>Monday we rolled out. We stopped by Skegness on the way, checked out the pier and grabbed some fish &#x26; chips from a place full of people who‚Äôd left Bangface - the vibe was nuts. With my fish, I got a mug of yorkshire tea and the most delicious pour of heineken I‚Äôve had in yonks. We made it through nearly the rest of the playlist. Finally got home at 8PM, and chucked everything in the wash before going to bed.</li>\n<li>(These are written and posted late, because I missed my normal potential writing slots on Sunday and Monday! And my publishing broke again! Sorry!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w40-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 40, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 40, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"Work was a bit of a blur this week.
