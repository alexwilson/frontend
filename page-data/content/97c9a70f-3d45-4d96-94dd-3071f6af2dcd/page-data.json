While we haven’t run a retrospective yet, we successfully sped back up to our normal pace of changes without any major issues. Already we’re in the throes of a heated US Election so the focus on reliability continues.</li>\n<li>At work my primary focus this week has been identifying and classifying consumers of a core [but not well understood] capability. I’ve been combing through our infrastructure accounts, our secrets storage and even our internal software catalog - and got told off for hitting it with too many API calls! So far I’ve identified at least 40 unique consumers, and have begun asking people about how they work: This might be big.</li>\n<li>This phase of (experimentally) wearing white might need to come to an end: Mysterious stains have appeared on a shirt that I can’t work out or get out.  Any and all tips are welcome!</li>\n<li>Recently my dear colleague Lee has been going through the same incredibly scary health condition that hit me last year. We’ve spoken about it: I wanted to say what I wish anyone had told me at the time. I’m seriously impressed at his bravery, honesty and articulation in in writing about it. Please follow his journey: <a href=\"https://leemoody.co.uk/blog/weeknotes/91/\">Dissected note</a>, <a href=\"https://leemoody.co.uk/blog/weeknotes/92/\">Horizontal note</a>.</li>\n<li>This week I joined the incredibly exclusive club that is people Alex M has called “post-technical”.  “For the record”, he said, “[He] doesn’t really think that”.  It has made my week.</li>\n<li>You won’t have noticed it, but this week I switched my blog over to <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/pull/2692\">using my own Webmentions service</a> (and in the process <a href=\"https://github.com/alexwilson/frontend/issues/1557\">have cleaned up lots of jank in my content store</a>). Images are still broken, but that’s now possible for me to fix.</li>\n<li>All this recent work on my blog is deliberate: There’s some articles I’ve wanted to produce for a while, but early decisions with this blog held me back. Now I’m nearly there, so I spent much of Saturday working on visuals to support the first piece of a series I’m excited about.  <a href=\"https://static.alexwilson.tech/ig-tmp/encryption-symmetry/signature.html\">Here's a teaser</a>.  Watch this space!</li>\n<li>Finally saw <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/\">Interstellar</a>, this week at BFI IMAX. Fantastic movie. Surreal experience walking out of that, and into Waterloo Station where someone was playing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuSsvM8B4Jc\">main theme</a> - given the plot, for a moment I had to double-take.</li>\n<li>Popped by the <a href=\"https://ebf.camra.org.uk/\">Ealing Beer Festival</a> on Friday and bumped into some of the apps team. Thus concludes my Broadway Belt - take that Nick!</li>\n<li>Went for a walk with LF between South Kensington and Clapham via Chelsea and Battersea. On the way I picked up a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornazo\">Horznazo</a> without realising the symbolism.</li>\n<li>Watched the final of the 2024 Euros in Vauxhall with some lovely people. When England scored our one and only goal, our raucous cheering spooked a group of tourists. When we lost, everyone left disappointed - except for a few stealth Spaniards who flipped us the bird on the way out: Graceful.</li>\n<li>Anyway the Horzazo was delicious.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"The aftermath of the election has been smooth at work.
