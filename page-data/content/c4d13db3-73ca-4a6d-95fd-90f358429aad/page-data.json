We opened one with a vulnerability exercise: Bringing in deeply-meaningful personal items and telling their (really our) stories.

My mood is definitely a bit weird. We won’t talk about Day 2. Genuinely excited to see the results, although they’re probably a next year thing.</li>\n<li>No, you’re wrong, it’s definitely too early in the year for mince pies.</li>\n<li>Oh, this week I spent nearly 2 hours trying to diagnose a problem, only to find I’d globally misconfigured NPM to use legacy peer dependency behaviour.
