A refurbished Herman Miller Mirra 2.  This is the first time I've properly invested time &#x26; money into getting a chair for the long-term and I'm so glad I did: it's endlessly adjustable and actually <em>really</em> comfortable.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re-assembling a working space is a huge milestone - not only is home-working now again a serious (sustainable) option, I now also have a place where I can write and fiddle around with music production.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Note to self: Write-up the disassembly/reassembly instructions for my desk.</li>\n<li>Note to Nick: Please bring back your weeknotes!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>God I really missed having an audio setup that sounded good.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have you seen the <a href=\"https://technabob.com/blog/2011/11/29/little-printer-berg/\">Little Printer</a>?  Several years late to the party.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It prints stuff, from the internet.</li>\n<li>Basically something of a dream machine. A way of instantly transforming, at relatively low cost, some information into something physical.</li>\n<li>Daily to-do lists, short summaries of the news, that kind of thing...</li>\n<li>This is the device I have needed for years!</li>\n<li>Unfortunately it no longer exists, so I've decided that building something like it is my next side-project.  This note is to create accountability!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since finishing Metroid Dread (100%!) I've been playing Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. Another blast from the past, I played the original on GBA a <em>very long time ago</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As far as remakes go, it's quite true to form. Mechanics have been improved, the new 3D graphics are brilliant, but at its core it's still the same game.</li>\n<li>Got to the end of the first in-game year and had accomplished everything it took me five in-game years to accomplish in the original.</li>\n<li>Coming later this year, are <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Pokemon-Shining-Pearl-1930567.html\">the Pokémon Diamond/Pearl remakes</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Advance-Wars-1-2-Re-Boot-Camp-1987406.html\">remake of the first two Advance Wars games</a>. I'm all here for these nostalgia-inducing releases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh yeah, I guess it's the Michaelmas/Autumn term now.  And I think I agreed to write a talk?</p>","excerpt":"Last week Nick helped me move my standing desk from Whitechapel, which was quite the adventure across London. ... and this week I got a…","frontmatter":{"title":"Weeknotes:  Space — 24th October 2021","tags":["weeknotes","thermal-printer","moving"],"date":"2021-10-24T17:48:16.000Z","last_modified_at":"","author":"alex","image_credit":null},"fields":{"formattedDate":"Sunday, October 24th, 2021","image":null,"date":"2021-10-24T17:48:16.000Z","slug":"/content/7c23bcc5-0182-4767-ac4b-c39cd910d9ca","_legacy_slug":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/content/7c23bcc5-0182-4767-ac4b-c39cd910d9ca","_legacy_slug":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2203825502","63159454"]}
