Made some small tweaks to this site, reviewed a few technical documents and have started exploring how to do dynamic imports of one-shot code into articles (which is both a personal and a work problem).  There's a pull-request I need to finish at work that brings more caching improvements.  Writing this mostly for personal accountability.</li>\n<li>Met <a href=\"https://alicebartlett.co.uk/\">Alice</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://georgecrawford.com/\">George</a> for what we're calling a <em>power-breakfast</em> on Wednesday.  Who needs drinks after work when you can just talk life, shop and gossip at 8AM.</li>\n<li>Ended up at a nomikai (飲み会) with Japanese colleagues.  Fun chatter.  Reminded me of going to these regularly years ago, only now I understand much more.  Wish I could keep up with more complex conversation though: It'd be nice to practice simpler Japanese with people at my level.</li>\n<li>Someone pointed out that Kanji are complicated for <em>everyone</em> and so I shouldn't let them hold me back, so I installed <a href=\"https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan\">Yomichan</a> (basically a dictionary?) and have been able to read (and write) a little bit.</li>\n<li>Numbers are weird, man.  <a href=\"https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counters-list/\">Did you know that there are at least 500 ways of counting things in Japanese</a>.  And dates can be confusing too.</li>\n<li>“Got any plans for the weekend?” asked the barista at the café someone once wrote a poem about.  “Yes”, I said without thinking, ”I think I'm seeing the Mario Movie twice”.  She nodded.  I explained.</li>\n<li>Anyway in the Friday sunshine I met some friends for lunch and we watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10366206\">John Wick 4</a>.  What a satisfying movie: So much about it was right.  I love the way that world-building works in this franchise.  Plot holes become more backstory and the lore grows even more complex.  Looking forward to <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7181546\">the spin-off</a>.</li>\n<li>Really enjoying the weather.  Evenings are still cold.  But the days are bright.</li>\n<li>Saw the <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6718170/\">Super Mario Bros.</a>, once as it turns out.  What's with video-games getting decent adaptations these days?  <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/the-super-mario-bros-movie-blue-star-lumalee\">Lumalee</a>'s nihilism was unexpected for what I hope was a children's film.  Maybe that's just the vibe.  Came second in a game of <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Play-wikiHow-to-Meme\">WikiHow to Meme</a> and later fourth in Mario Kart.</li>\n<li>Chess championship is heating up.  <a href=\"https://www.chess.com/news/view/fide-world-chess-championship-2023-game-1\">Game one is a draw</a>.  No Carlsen makes it a lot more interesting to watch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w14.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>","excerpt":"Week has flown by.
