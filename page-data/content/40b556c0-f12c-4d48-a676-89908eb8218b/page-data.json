I now own another pair of trainers, but between discounts and clever accounting on my part these were <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv0o-nQtFth\">basically free</a>.</li>\n<li>Spent oodles and oodles of time digging through JavaScript module behaviour.</li>\n<li>After feeling very rotten over the weekend and Monday, I spent the entire week working from home.  In part, just in case I was contagious, and in part because I don't want to catch anything before flying next week.  I don't think I could be remote full-time: Video-calls are much more draining <em>even</em> with a really nice set-up — but my main issue is a lack of self-discipline around stopping the workday from bleeding into the evening - no matter how early I start.</li>\n<li>But I did get to walk around South West London a lot.  No two days did I take the same route to go, and really surprised myself with how many things I just hadn't seen in two and a bit years of living here.</li>\n<li>PVO is back, baby!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e597a8b5-f71a-4099-9add-d0e3c1613348\">Kristo &#x26; I got published this week, talking about an upcoming shortage of data centre power</a>, which is my first byline at the FT.  The work involved was fairly straightforward (and, quick) — we did the majority of it at the start of September, but seeing the final piece is something else.  We got promoted in several places, and a fairly interesting reception.  The comments did not disappoint!</li>\n<li>Side-note, there are many things we did not talk about - but something I am fascinated by is Microsoft's intention to build their own private nuclear power plants.  (No, they weren't inspired by Oppenheimer - they just saw this coming).</li>\n<li>My final exam was supposed to happen this week.  Not bitter.</li>\n<li>Oh yeah, and I got a haircut.  It's something a bit different.  I'm not sure if I like it.  We'll see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w40.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 40, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 40, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"Four weeknotes in one.
