Thursday was a bank holiday and together with Friday made for an extended “long weekend”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This week in data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maximum height: 332.6m</li>\n<li>Kowloon Dairy products consumed: 7</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After work on Tuesday evening I went to the top of Landmark 81 - the tallest building in Vietnam, the 2nd tallest in SEA and the 17th tallest in the world. It is also, by at least 100 meters, the highest I have ever been.  Reaching the top, they strapped me to a pole and let me walk right up to the edge, where I took a few precarious photos and a selfie, right before scurrying right back down to ground level.  Gorgeous view though, well worth the nerves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wrestled with some NodeJS meta-programming which I really didn't enjoy. Sometimes I think we had it good with n-gage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>And on Wednesday, REDACTED.  All I’m saying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Thursday I packed up, picked up some laundry, had some emergency banh mi, and swatted away the biggest cockroach you ever did see, before collapsing into an airplane seat.  Onboard I watched <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8368368\">The Apprentice (2024)</a>, which I really rate, it’s a very good movie.  Solid 3/5.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where to?  Hong Kong, meaning roasts, dim sum, and those egg tarts that people who’ve never heard of pasteis de nata rave about.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I love Hong Kong.  If you were to slice London off from the rest of the UK, and to place it in southern China, you’d end up with, well, <em>Hong Kong</em>.  Immediately after landing, while taxiing to the terminal, I saw the familiar outline of UK-style ambulances and had to pinch myself.  After leaving the airports all the road-signs and the preponderance of M&#x26;S/F&#x26;M/etc. just feel uncanny.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Friday was mostly retracing my steps from my last (and only) visit <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/dc39b27d-b4f4-401c-83c2-c43d16a10a0d\">in 2019</a>: Seeing which things had changed, and which things had not.  While some wonderful business had closed or moved on, many things were the same and I even roughly recalled how to navigate Central.  Most striking [after some events] was just how much cleaner everything seemed, right down to a feeling that there was far less street art.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Michelin star dumplings though.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hiked “The Dragon’s Back” which was a pretty delightful trail.  Strava botched the recording.  Ran back to Chai Wan afterwards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exposure to grade 1 kanji led to a few “oh huh that’s cool” moments where I could \"\"\"understand\"\"\" some written Chinese, or more accurately, spot when the translation into English was different.  This is — to anyone who knows me — something I am remarkably excited about because not even six months ago this felt impossible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Took some nice photos.  I thought so at least.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some of the conversations you overhear are just - fantastic.  “Sometimes I just have the impulse to get off at the wrong stop, I'm just spontaneous like that, you know?”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nearly went to a party with an interesting line-up, only to discover that it had also happened in Tokyo the night before, only there that I knew the promoter, and it was 1/3 of the price.  Or in more familiar terms, it put even the priciest of London based clubs to shame!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This trip was too impromptu to make any real plans, but I did manage to coincide with LF, and we did a lot of catching-up, walking and eating.  We made it from Sheung Wan to Causeway, and to Tsim Sha Tsui the long way around.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We had breakfast/lunch on my quest for omiyage before stopping for lunch at “that dingy place in the train station”.  You know the one.  Being excited to see Dim Sum at a reasonable price, I ordered nearly the entire menu, leading to an funny situation where our neighbouring table accidentally helped themselves to some tea - and when we encountered them to take more - they were so mortified that they debated (not in English) buying the same type of tea to pay us back.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Walked across Kowloon to the megalith that is Kowloon West train station, frankly in awe at the scale of some of the more recent construction work.  One day I want to take a train from here going north.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nice to see UK plugs.  Funny to see them next to Huawei ethernet ports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3290257/helpers-bedtime-stories/\">It’s not all good, though</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w12-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 12, 2024\" title=\"Collage of week 12, 2024\"></p>","excerpt":"If last week marked my first serious travel since the big move, this week marked my proper first holiday - and with it, more travel…"},"slug":"/content/b2f53898-7914-40dc-b0a9-40f75e49b09a"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"b2f53898-7914-40dc-b0a9-40f75e49b09a"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1302009070","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
