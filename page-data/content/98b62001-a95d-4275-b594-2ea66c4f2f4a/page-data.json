Writing this from the tiny desk in my tiny hotel room.</li>\n<li>I worked Monday, Tuesday &#x26; Wednesday which were quite intense but then went by very quickly.  Monday and Wednesday I crammed in a lot of and writing to ensure all the things would keep going.</li>\n<li>Tuesday was my team's (group tech leadership) first away day since I joined.  We met at a vendor office in Shoreditch to retrospect over the year and examine topics including our technology strategy in more depth than we usually can.  We don't spend much time together as a team, so on top of the day itself I enjoyed having a natter.  We closed with 2 Truths &#x26; 1 Lie and I managed to fool the room which, you know, I'm not sure what that says about me but there we go.</li>\n<li>A perfect storm of the right conditions set me up to enjoy the worst case of jet-lag I've ever had: I barely slept Tuesday and Wednesday night (nerves, and, an early start).  Early Finnair flight was lovely and the airport lounge in Helsinki was even lovelier.  I drowned my tiredness in Bloody Marys.  But then on the flight to Tokyo, I ended up sitting next to a person who had no concept of personal space, staying still or of remaining still when the lights went off.  When I landed I was an absolute wreck, but, I smugly made it through the immigration and customs control systems before anyone else on my plane because I'd filled in everything online before taking off.</li>\n<li>The route took us over the North Pole, and just in case you don't believe me, Finnair gave me a certificate which proves that it happened.  Unfortunately I couldn't see the northern lights either through the window or through the plane cams, so instead I watched a few forgettable movies.</li>\n<li>Getting out of Haneda airport I had a very strong sense of de-ja-vu to the time, roughly 5 years ago, I posted a twitter thread (gosh, remember twitter!?) — I think about that twitter thread a lot and about what went wrong.</li>\n<li>I managed to make it from the airport, via monorail, to my hotel, and immediately to a dinner - all without needing a map.  People talk about navigating Tokyo being confusing but honestly the signage is far better than anywhere else I've ever been - and all you really need to remember is compass directions.  Dinner turned out to be actually a Nikkei work drinks with a surprise guest, which then morphed into into karaoke.  I somehow withstood the karaoke.  There are videos.</li>\n<li>Saturday I woke up with a surprisingly clear head, at a sensible time, located breakfast - and then started walking vaguely in the direction of my go-to spot in Hibiya Park to absorb some sunlight to minimise the jet-lag.  Spent the rest of the day walking around Eastern Tokyo and managed to do about 30km of walking.  Wrapped up by walking to Asakusa to meet <a href=\"https://lukeblaney.co.uk/\">Luke</a> for dinner and unlimited drinks.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately all the baseball games I'd love to see are sold out! :(</li>\n<li>Sunday was when the jet-lag really hit - the 2nd day is always the worst.  The morning started with JK, F, S and I panicking on a group-chat as we realised that the Tokyo Half was happening so all the roads were closed - and that it was raining very heavily.  We all crawled into a K car and drove to Kawaguchiko's Oishi park to go canoeing.  After a scare - which involved me nearly capsizing our boat - we got into a rhythm and somehow even got a certificate saying that we're able to canoe.  By the time we were done, the weather really started to clear up - and so we got a fantastic view of Fuji - which was my first time seeing it! (back in 2018 it was always either foggy, cloudy or hazy).</li>\n<li>There really isn't anything quite like the first sip of a beer, I think 1 order of beer before switching to anything else (highball?) is the optimal way to drink.</li>\n<li>Pleased to say that, when ordering at various places, my broken Japanese has fooled a few people.  Although I was totally stumped and subsequently embarrassed while ordering a coffee.  ”ごめん！日本語がしか少し話せます。英語でもう一度言ってお願いします？” , “Would you like your coffee in or to go?”, “Oh, to go please　…　…　…　…　…　…　…　<strong>アリガトウゴザイマ—ス</strong>！”</li>\n<li>Very sparse plans for next week, but I'm aiming not to open this laptop at all, let's see.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w41.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 41, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 41, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"Finally on holiday!
