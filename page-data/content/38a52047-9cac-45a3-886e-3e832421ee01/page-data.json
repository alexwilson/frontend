I hate to shatter the illusion† but it turns out to be a series of tests and measures to assess overall health, much like in many other countries (other than, for some reason, the UK).  To all you fellow-watchers of American sitcoms, it’s  \"\"\"a physical\"\"\".</li>\n<li>But the REAL headline of the week is: Monday I showed up bright and early at the Shibaura-konan ward office to finally collect my MyNumber card. The whole process was pretty fast: I had to review some documents, set some passwords and then I walked out with the future of paperwork.</li>\n<li>Starting to think that Next.JS belongs in the same part of my resume as Magento, IYKWIM.</li>\n<li>At work we had a new-starter lunch with leadership, which gave the opportunity to submit questions ahead of time.  Thinking they would be anonymised, filtered or moderated, I submitted far too many to count.  I came to regret this — because on the print-outs I saw that nearly all the questions were from me.  Whoopsie!</li>\n<li>Had a reunion of my final stage interview (both the interviewer and interpreter) at the same lunch, which was also a genuine delight.</li>\n<li>The health-checkup was, well, fine.  None of the immediate results were worrying.  I rocked up to the Kojima Productions building and then was sent around the various stations (A1, A2, B1, etc...) doing various checks until I was sent on my way.  I foolishly signed up for a few extra blood-tests and had to lie down for 10 minutes afterwards.</li>\n<li>Even though I’d done Monday’s homework, I skipped Thursday’s Japanese class and went to eat some yakiniku instead to recuperate from the tests. It helped. A lot.</li>\n<li>Went to <a href=\"https://sonic.gmo/\">GMO Sonic</a> (which also required figuring out how to buy tickets, so so complicated) to tick seeing a Peggy Gou set and a Anyma set off of my bucket list, and I also was very pleasantly surprised by Skrillex’s closing set. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17869364529280504/\">All sets were high production value, but legitimately lots of fun</a>.  And during Skrillex’s set I was adopted by a group of 20-somethings who were incredibly excited to have a brit in their midst.  They performed well: good moshing.</li>\n<li>Did you know Skrillex cut his hair?</li>\n<li>Highlight of GMO Sonic was the very attentive security who would rush into the crowd every time a person was lifted ont another person’s shoulders.  They’d help them back down, tell them not to do it again, and then disappear.  This happened a lot more than you’d think.</li>\n<li>Did a few more flat viewings at the weekend, where I saw even more promising candidates: My spreadsheet is <em>very</em> long at this point.  The trouble is that nearly all of them have a couple of trade-offs which are hard to accept for the 2-year (!!!!) minimum-term of these contracts.  And it’s a bit of a red flag if a place is left available for too long while everything around it is being snapped up...</li>\n<li>†With these medical check-ups, you <em>can</em> pay for extra tests, and depending on the clinic, there may be a lot to choose from.  But since they’re not necessary, they aren’t covered by medical insurance, so you pay for everything at-cost.  That can rack up fast.  But if you’re a content creator that’s an easy business expense, so that’s why all the content creators seem to be having these magical health-tourism-style holistic medical checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w4-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 4, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 4, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"This week brought the fabled health-check, of Instagram/TikTok/YouTube creator fame.
