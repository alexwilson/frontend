The parks are chokka.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the weather: It has been cold, and dark, and damp, and miserable all week.</li>\n<li>Between the weather and immediately jumping back into work, even though it was a few days, I was suffering a proper holiday hangover this week.</li>\n<li>Many years ago I read <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919\">‚ÄúWorking Effectively with Legacy Code‚Äù</a>, and it excited me to work with gnarly codebases.  Well, let‚Äôs just say I burned a lot of that excitement this week.</li>\n<li>After missing 3 lessons in a row, Japanese class was <em>incredibly</em> rough.  We made it, in the end, but wow there were moments where I doubted myself.  Who‚Äôd have guessed that learning a language is hard.</li>\n<li>Very thought provoking catch-up on Wednesday evening. üòÖ</li>\n<li>Omiyage of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_cake\">sweetheart cake</a> (ËÄÅÂ©ÜÈ§Ö) was very well received.  I had a spare which I stuck in the microwave - and - wow wow wow!</li>\n<li>Met up with the KP massive on Friday for the 3 Ds: Dinner, Drinks and Darts.  Walked in not knowing how to hold a dart, walked out having figured out how to aim.  Ah well.  I ate a lot of meat.</li>\n<li>What a year since <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/580545ab-a50f-47bb-ada9-095953c0ef87\">the last time I spoke those words</a>, eh?  Worst of all, <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2025/03/28/london-food-hall-filled-small-businesses-knocked-900-flats-22811656/\">Mercato is shutting down</a>: News made me feel a little homesick, or nostalgic, or something like that.  Many happy memories in that place.  I miss you London lot.</li>\n<li>Rewatched the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy over the weekend: They‚Äôre still excellent, but it really feels like #2 stands above the rest.</li>\n<li>Have a great week!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w13-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 13, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 13, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Cherry blossom season is upon us, and it‚Äôs gorgeous.
