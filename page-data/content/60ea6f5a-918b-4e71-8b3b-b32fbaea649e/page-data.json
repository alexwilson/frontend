From a purist perspective - in GitOps - even one-off tasks need to go into Git.  And these operations are supposed to be immutable so you can’t just <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/12/introducing-suspended-jobs/\">suspend</a> them and come back later.  I’m sure I’ve misunderstood something?  There has to be a better way.</li>\n<li>Learned some very interesting and exciting familial lore, which led me into discovering that <a href=\"https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/\">there is a tartan registry</a>, and to realising that the GDS lot still haven't got to it.  Starting to understand the complaining about the Londoners.</li>\n<li>The word \"Allocations\" has been sitting rather ominously at the top of these notes, which I have been completely unable to decipher.  And so it has become the title of this week’s notes.</li>\n<li>Accidentally talked myself into a lunch invite, and am very glad I did because the conversation was great, but the discovery of a brand new lunch place offering an <em>above-average</em> level of spice is even greater.</li>\n<li>I somehow injured my foot, which is <em>at least</em> as annoying as it is painful, as it has turned walking into an event.  During the week I saw a doctor who immediately ordered an X-ray which came back clear.  Got some mild painkillers in the form of plasters.  No running for a while, no gym for a slightly shorter while.</li>\n<li>After a few weeks of back and forth I am now up by one whole bank account, this one with significantly better rates and services than my primary account.  Chuffed.</li>\n<li>Finally went to <a href=\"https://www.devilcraft.jp/\">DevilCraft</a> with some friends, and, fine, I get it, Chicago-style pizza is great.  Karaoke on the way out where I finally got a track on that I’ve been trying to get since JK’s leaving drinks and — no it really wasn’t worth it.</li>\n<li>Taco Rice is pretty nice, eh?</li>\n<li>Sunday’s plan was cancelled, so a coffee with RL morphed into dinner and a drink with the boys in blue, in town for a business trip and a big release.  Night-cap <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/82bd3ca5-74b6-4f2b-a680-31690375eb77\">in the bar Bato once took me to</a>.  We’ve come full circle, eh?</li>\n<li>We also visited the <a href=\"https://extinct-media-museum.blog.jp/\">Extinct Media Museum</a> which has been on my radar for <em>years</em>.  They have a stellar collection of old cameras, computers, phones, etc.  Almost all of which still work and which can be handled.  There was an even an original Aibo.</li>\n<li>I’ll never be able to look one of those things in the eye again.</li>\n<li>Words matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w31-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 31, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 31, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"A week of doing things I'd meant to do for literally years.
