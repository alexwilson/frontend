I begin in Osaka, following my defeat (or victory?) at the Queueing Olympics.</li>\n<li>Originally my plan is to be back in Tokyo quite early, but I cancel my plans on Tuesday to instead spend the day pottering about Osaka and looking at and eating things.  The city has a very different atmosphere which I love.</li>\n<li>This also includes possibly the most unhealthy Tonkatsu lunch I will ever eat.</li>\n<li>I spend some time over the week iterating on a design-document and corresponding schema, which involves going back to the drawing board a few times.  The combination of short week and many iterations means I make less net progress than I’d hoped to.</li>\n<li>New 5K PB is a nice small win.</li>\n<li>In the context of journalism, I learn a fair bit about financial reporting obligations in Japan, which for a place with so much paperwork turn out to be surprisingly difficult.  Or maybe I’m too used to Company House?</li>\n<li>I’m introduced to a new spot which I’m afraid I have to gatekeep because I will be back.  The owner is great and it’s a nice time with tasty drinks and incredible looking food, although because I’m British and must grumble about something, the open-mic Karaoke is at times distracting.</li>\n<li>Unrelatedly I break one of my rules and end up feeling some hangxiety the next day.  Co-Star’s sass doesn’t help.</li>\n<li>What does help is that I hit the milestone of having apparently learned 100 Kanji.  I can now recognize many in signs and menus, but it’s still not enough to fully navigate or order food.  Roughly another 2000 to go for “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji\">functional literacy</a>”, hah!</li>\n<li>While waiting for an incident to be resolved, I have a good catch-up and get to speak to some people I’ve been meaning to, followed by an underwhelming mini-adventure to Hibiya for a campaign.</li>\n<li>The weekend’s plans are discarded to admin, prompted by a tax bill.  I pay the bill in cash, but not before filling out a lot of paperwork and sending a few letters.  I have the knack of this now, and so it’s mostly undoing my past mistakes.  I’m getting dangerously close to being able to pay for these things digitally - these are the perks of having a long legal name.</li>\n<li>Highlight of the week is the dinner which closes it, which, after a week of mostly yakitori, is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obanzai\">Obanzai</a> - Kyoto’s speciality.  Demonstrably healthier and tastier.  I break away a few beats too early with some goodies.</li>\n<li>Maybe don’t text about vomit on the train, yeah?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/img_4078-collage_original.jpeg\" alt=\"Collage of week 39, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 39, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"Three-day work week this week.
