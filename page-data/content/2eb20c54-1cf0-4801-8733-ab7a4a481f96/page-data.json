The process itself is actually great and I'm enjoying how far it's come since the days of endless spreadsheets and Salesforce.  What's confusing is the specific arrangement I'm pursuing where I can't find any one person who can tell me what to do or how to do it.  So this week you may call me <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Josef-K\">Josef</a>.</li>\n<li>Soon I start working on the problem which I've previously referred to as the <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/topic/product-coexistence\">“Product Coexistence problem“</a>, which through reframing has become about pragmatically introducing support for extending front-ends.  It's exciting and should result in pushing technical boundaries in a constructive way.  I'm excited about the implications for one-shot content, like, say, the interactive charts we publish.</li>\n<li>Last week when I mentioned I was coming down with something, it turned out that I had mostly-asymptomatic Covid, which I wouldn't have caught without routine testing. Other than a sore throat on Saturday I didn't have a single trace. Goes to show that testing helps. And this net trend towards milder symptoms is <em>probably</em> a good thing?</li>\n<li>Unfortunately the timing meant I missed seeing and catching-up with coworkers from our Bulgarian office, and the official reception for the launch of the <a href=\"https://app.ft.com/crossword\">FT Crossword app</a>.  I'll catch you next time, Mr T.</li>\n<li>Alex Kondov's <a href=\"https://www.writerstavern.io/\">Tavern</a> is a delightfully novel idea: Write a little bit towards a weekly prompt.  I wrote something super cringey about the Ship of Theseus.</li>\n<li>Oh, yeah, speaking of cringe, I'm still watching Bleach.  I can't stop myself.</li>\n<li>In my teens, the coding and study sessions that weren't powered by <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/above-beyond-trance-around-the-world/id993499023\">trance</a> and radio 1 were powered by weirder genres of music like <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/22-05-2011\">UK hardcore</a> and J-core.  Unfortunately both genres of music have really fallen into obscurity, and prompted by some nostalgia I spent most of the weekend trying to track down old J-core albums and sets.  Archival might become a passion project and I'd appreciate any help.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Reader, this week I've been navigating many teams, systems and process going through a procurement process.
