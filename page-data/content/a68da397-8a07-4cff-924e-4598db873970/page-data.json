Somehow I’m trapped inside a rare virtuous cycle and reader - I am <em>here</em> for it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This week I drew out two circuits: One short, through Putney Park Avenue, and the other, long, through Putney &#x26; Wimbledon Commons.  I skipped going to any Eurovision parties to give them a try.</li>\n<li>What I’m most proud of is making sure there’s a good way of running at home, with other plans. This is a huge step which will make it a lot harder to procrastinate.  This is a good thing!</li>\n<li>After this second week of running, my legs still hurt. For some reason I started doing press-ups &#x26; planks again. Now the rest of me hurts too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve always found it hard to write about work, because sensitivity-aside it’s hard to find the right level of detail, but there were some distinct things which happened this week.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are two big tech-leadership-shaped things on my plate right now, near-opposite-ends of whatever linear scale technology leadership fits onto. However, my contributions feel meaningful and I feel like I’m making progress. On Friday I went to senior-leadership meetings for both (me, more listening than talking) which was a good milestone for both.</li>\n<li>Currently I’m overseeing four teams (two temporarily as cover) and all four had significant moments I got to share this week. Desperately hoping that I actually am helping considering the limited time. I’m (genuinely) lucky to work with such excellent tech leads.</li>\n<li>Today I travelled to the Old Truman Brewery to represent the FT at the <a href=\"https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com/\">Silicon Milkroundabout</a> which is a careers fair. Speaking to dozens of people today, I remembered that I’m relatively confident and that I love working at the FT. For SMR leadership, “Even Better If” you foster a more diverse audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What else?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning Japanese is going well! I found some lessons and can now construct (relatively) complex sentences. However vocabulary is the really difficult bit and I’ve barely started. Pray for me.</li>\n<li>A recent Metroid Dread update added a new mode: Boss Rush. Currently I’m sub-17 minutes, which I think is pretty good for playing it so little. It’s nice having a “bite-sized” Metroid experience that isn’t a speedrun.</li>\n<li>On a Marvel binge this week I finally watched both <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10234724/\">Moon Knight</a> &#x26; <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9140560/\">Wandavision</a>. Love them, but, let’s be real: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845738/\">Higurashi</a> did it better.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"I’m still running.
