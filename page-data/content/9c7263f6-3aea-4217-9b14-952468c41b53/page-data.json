The long-tail shows how gradual the recovery has been.</li>\n<li>The major symptoms were a dry-cough (which became a wet cough the next day), a five-day-long headache, fatigue (which hasn't gone entirely yet).  Oh, and sneezing, <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-sneezing\">which is how I know the vaccine is still doing something</a>.</li>\n<li>At some point I stopped being able to smell anything, which is a story involving food that I'd really rather not go into.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Isolation has been interesting: Even without the mandate I haven't felt well enough to go outdoors or do anything particularly strenuous.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Someone on a video-call was walking from Euston to Paddington, which was great &#x26; felt like my own private livestream.  Yes, I live in this city, but it's still cool to see the sights from my living room.</li>\n<li>Inspired by a good friend's advice, I finally switched (downgraded?) from an eGPU to a Plugable dock. It has made a world of positive difference to work-from-home setup: While some software is slower, everything is way more stable - and my setup is miles smaller.</li>\n<li>I ran a bit too far right before coming down with Covid, so this has forced me to recover my legs/knees a bit.  I've been encouraged to rest a bit longer, so I'll do that, and reset my programme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at the upside, this has been an excellent chance to spend some time with television &#x26; bad video-games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How good was Jimmy &#x26; Kim's plan in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476\">Better Call Saul</a>?!  That entire episode was great.</li>\n<li>Finishing the re-watch of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/\">Breaking Bad</a>. A decade after seeing it for the first time, the series really hits different: Walt is a jerk from nearly the very start - and both Mike &#x26; Saul Goodman are <em>objectively</em> good people in a bad spot.  Is this personal growth?!</li>\n<li>After years of being recommended it, I caved and played through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpse_Party\">Corpse Party</a>. With mystery/horror stories, plot-twists can be interesting, but, this had a few too many making the gameplay &#x26; plot feel incredibly drawn-out &#x26; contrived.  Again, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higurashi:_When_They_Cry\">Higurashi</a> did it better.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Week two of Covid: Last Saturday was the peak of my symptoms, and one long week later, I'm feeling somewhere between 93-96%.
