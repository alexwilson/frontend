We order two naans and a side of fish.  This is pit-stop on the way to cocktails after a few hours in the sun.</li>\n<li>Tuesday ends at Birmingham’s most notorious institution: Maccies on the Ramp.  We have a tradition, born in darker days, which always finds us either here or Temple Row.  We meet near Ikon and take the long way round discussing startups and runners.</li>\n<li>Wednesday’s dinner is a humble Meal Deal: It’s a cost-effective way of powering our mini-celebration of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/48991574\">St Swithin’s day</a>. There’s two excellent coffees - I haven’t had espresso drinks in a hot minute so these keep me up into the wee hours.  The night ends with me extolling the virtues of powdered jasmine tea - which is perfectly proportioned to blend with a pint of iced water.  Then I go for a (very) long walk.</li>\n<li>Thursday is a killer serving of Falafel &#x26; Halloumi with a side of Ayran.  It caps AN’s leaving drinks - which are bittersweet - where I see some great people and am explicitly asked not to blog about something.  Brunch is an oatmeal smoothie(!) along the crescent following a pretty decent 5K time.</li>\n<li>Friday’s lunch runs long — I end up playing leaving-buddy — and so for dinner I end up eating reheated Daal on a balcony overlooking the river and the skyline, and it’s <em>legitimately</em> fire.</li>\n<li>Saturday is the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CwkBCtMgbvL/\">Carbonara pizza</a> at Pizza Pilgrims.  What started as birthday plans in March have morphed a few times until the latest weather-motivated pivot puts us in Mercato Metropolitano. Some people come, some people don’t, and eventually us stragglers find ourselves at the MP.  FS, MT and I have a tradition, formed in New Products days, which repeatedly finds us here, eating spaghetti.  It's nice to say goodbye to Mercato.</li>\n<li>Sunday is a a relaxed day - the first day with a poor step-count - and dinner is Loobia Polo in Greenland followed by dessert from Creamz in Wembley.  This is the exact tube journey I made last Saturday, which makes for reflection.  After talking about pivoting in the morning, I’m brought up-to-date on memes in the evening.</li>\n<li>Do I miss Birmingham?  Do I miss London?  I’m not sure.  I miss most of the people though.  Even the people I didn’t really speak to.</li>\n<li>My return to the UK had a todo-list of 3 major items of which I failed 2.  Meaning now I have to send an awkward email.  I also had a wish-list of 3 items, of which I also completed 2: ask me about the 1 sometime, it’s a funny story.</li>\n<li>Oats for breakfast every day.</li>\n<li>I’m not the same person I was when I left, and that was only six months ago.</li>\n<li>Words matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w29-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 29, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 29, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"This week’s story is best told through its dinners.
