Now I know how the Daleks must feel.</li>\n<li>This was a shorter week at work and it felt pretty hefty at times, but already far better than last week.  Reflecting, something I need to do a lot more of is time-blocking: Some documents just need to be written.  It’s like being in the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/08/26/15-tech-leaders-on-why-and-how-ctos-should-find-time-to-code/\">critical-path of code</a>, only, without the code - and usually docs can’t “just” be passed onto someone else.</li>\n<li>On Wednesday, I went to an impromptu leaving drinks for a conspicuously-anonymous friend moving to NYC the next day.  Our small group merged with another and I left having had one of the top-ten strangest conversations of all time - and with a job offer for a non-existent company.</li>\n<li>My new mission is to make highballs happen because they’re more refreshing than beer, and make me look cooler than drinking wine.

While there I watched a few panels and saw the same man ask the same question at three different panels - it felt just like being at a tech conference.  Real-talk: I’m genuinely very hyped for <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21836620/\">Skandal</a> when it launches in two weeks time.</li>\n<li>Having recovered from overtraining earlier this year, these past few weeks I’ve been running again.  At the risk of sounding cliched - every time I run, I remember how much I <em>love</em> it - so I’m going for consistency this time round: Following <a href=\"https://aceew.me/\">Aaron’s</a> advice, I’m taking it slower and <a href=\"https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/beginners/a760176/heart-rate-training-the-basics/\">zone training</a> to work on recovery and endurance.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Reader, this week I’ve been engaged in battle with my bathroom sink: On the verge of calling in reinforcements (a plumber) I had a mild…"},"slug":"/content/90ef6cce-d31a-4cac-8f61-98e4b48209c3","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":[]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"90ef6cce-d31a-4cac-8f61-98e4b48209c3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
