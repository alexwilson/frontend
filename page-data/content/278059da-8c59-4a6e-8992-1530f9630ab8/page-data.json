But all in good time.</li>\n<li>Please mind the gap.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Venturing Outside</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This weekend I finally broke the cycle of not-doing-very-much courtesy of the pandemic and it's siblings anxiety &#x26; social-isolation.</li>\n<li>Went kayaking with some friends this weekend. And had a picnic. It was nice.</li>\n<li>Making a boat go in a straight line <em>[against water, and wind]</em> is rather difficult, it turns out.</li>\n<li>Later met a friend for a drink. At a pub? (they still exist). Walked home. It was also nice.</li>\n<li>We both got hit on by someone who was very, very under the influence of something. That was not so nice.</li>\n<li>My body hurts from rowing, probably not helped by walking. This is a troubling sign.</li>\n<li>Actually, sorry, I lied, last weekend I celebrated a friend's birthday in Victoria park.  That was the first thing I did in meatspace recently.</li>\n<li>Seeing people, meeting new ones (post-RAT), is pretty surreal honestly. I'm feeling a sense of enthused-trepidation about the whole thing.</li>\n<li>I believe that when the highlight of your weekend is \"hanging tarpaulin between three trees just in case it rains\"\nyou are entitled to experiencing whichever life-crisis you want.</li>\n<li>In definitely unrelated news, I am now experiencing a mid-20s crisis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Gap</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Aka \"the elephant in the room\", or, \"Alex, why did you stop writing weeknotes, and why did you slow down writing more generally?\"</li>\n<li>The short-answer: I did not have much to say for a little bit.  I broke the streak.</li>\n<li>Broken streaks are, as I'm sure you've learned from your past few failed attempts to learn German on Duolingo (<em>c'mon let's be honest reader?</em>), <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/why-breaking-a-streak-feels-so-awful.html\">ironically very self-defeating</a>!</li>\n<li>Our streaks play at loss-aversion. Why break that number which is reaching its high hundreds?\nBut ... What happens when we inevitably miss a day, and lose that number?  Will that number ever climb back up?  <em>Is there even any point?</em></li>\n<li>Honestly I'm petrified of breaking my Apple-Health Activity streak.  Or my Kindle streak.</li>\n<li>Real lesson here, is that keeping up a streak is a very weak form of motivation.  I'm going to work on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Minding The Gap</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Okay, so this phrase is on my mind because I have been thinking about the London Underground a lot recently.</li>\n<li>It might just be me? But I used to legitimately dislike the sort-of outside stations like Faringdon.  Now I really enjoy them?</li>\n<li>The concept of Kings Cross station being entirely underground seems quite unpleasant.</li>\n<li>That said why do we listen to grumpy Brits talking about gaps?  I miss the tunes that play on the JR. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTD6_k-9bkU\">Seseragi brings back memories</a>.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"I am writing weeknotes once more.
