It brings a kind-of existential clarity to your priorities and your life.  The (usually) sleepless night before really helps in setting the mood to answer such difficult questions as “What am I even doing with my life?”.</li>\n<li>It was beautiful though.  Wish you could have seen it.</li>\n<li>This week was largely spent in spreadsheets, changing (<em>occasionally</em> moving) cells.  And then speaking to people about the changes.  I also spent some time doing some targeted deep-dives into our tech-stack, to look at personalisation and caching logic.  A pull-request may have been produced, and subsequently rejected.</li>\n<li>M﻿y new vice this week is sudoku.  I reinstalled <a href=\"https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/\">Good Sudoku</a> while watching the final season of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/\">Killing Eve</a>, and then a day later caught myself doing one during a slightly more talk-y meeting.  According to screentime I have over 24 hours in-game.  <em>Yikes</em>.</li>\n<li>R﻿eally disappointed at where Killing Eve went BTW.  Not sure if it's the books, or the screenplay, but season 4 was a real struggle.</li>\n<li>Also currently at 8 pumpkin spice lattes this week, and that doesn't include today.  I can stop any time I want.</li>\n<li>O﻿k!  My gate is now open, hitting publish!</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"There's something quite magical about watching the sunrise from an airport lounge.
