Sorry, no, this isn’t <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cXDgFwE13g\">the song by Skrillex</a>. These are the first weeknotes I’ve published of 2019, hopefully soon to be followed by my retrospective of 2018.</p>\n<h3>From resizing images to infrastructure problems</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>After migrating the original version of the application to Kubernetes last year, this week (specifically, Sunday) <a href=\"https://github.com/imagecdn/imagecdn/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">I updated ImageCDN to v2</a>, a rewrite in Node. I placed a strong emphasis on trying to improve its concurrency as I found that the greatest limitation with PHP and PHP-PM was that it was very easy to overload the service and bring it down.</li>\n<li>Along the way of rewriting the ImageCDN core I had a lot of fun learning about <a href=\"https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips/\">libvips</a>, which is a superb if somewhat underrated image processing library. With more-or-less the same file-size output as ImageMagick, libvips is able to produce better, more-accurate images with significantly less memory usage. Hopefully I will be able to use it in future projects. Expect a write-up!</li>\n<li>Why the move back from Kubernetes?  It’s a really nice technology but it isn’t deploy-and-forget when dealing with non-trivial workloads despite the hype. Cluster maintenance is required as time goes on, and to be effective it is essential to allocate a healthy portion of the cluster resources to monitoring and observability activities. Which adds up pretty quickly. For a free service this meant a lot of operational overhead and a pretty costly cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Di-slack-tions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>My experiment with Slack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/antoligy/status/1088183564770992135\">has had an interesting result</a>.</li>\n<li>At first I got a lot of comments from people mildly irritated that I was no longer immediately reachable, but overall it has been ok. Seeing this success I started rolling this change out to my other messaging apps, and started using email a little bit more for managing notifications.</li>\n<li>Now I have noticed an interesting behaviour pattern: When I've sent a message or I am expecting a reply from someone (say I am in a Slack conversation), I actively go into a \"polling loop\", cycling between the task I am working on and the messaging platform I am expecting a reply on. It's certainly better than before, but is definitely still rather draining.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m doing a talk! At <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-MzfqIqCy/events/fppxlqyzfbzb/\">BrumJS on the 19th of March</a>. My topic is is software quality, how it is largely misunderstood, how only a small portion can be handled by “QA”, and then how to measure and improve it. I will be writing it up after-the-fact.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Nintendo seem to have restarted development on Metroid Prime 4, which sounds bad. Actually it's great news: Now Retro Studios are taking the reigns. My nostalgia bias is incredibly happy that Retro is picking this up, by my nostalgic inner-child is upset that this means the release date has been pushed back indefinitely. I <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Dread\">Dread</a> to think how long we might have to wait.</li>\n<li>I’ve started planning a holiday to visit Hong Kong: Asia is incredibly exciting region and I’m quite thrilled to explore a new city!</li>\n<li>Booking flights led me into the rabbit-hole of British Airways’ outfit of Airbus A380s and all of the quirks. Most amusing is Seat 25D: It is a standard, economy-class seat with all of the usual amenities of British Airways Economy. However, row 24 skips seat D to allow an escape-hatch for the crew’s cabin underneath, meaning that 25D includes double the normal leg-room. On its own, this isn’t too exciting, but BA took this in stride and reserved all of these seats for their Silver-tier members and up, charging a little extra for the seat with the promise of free champagne.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Gotcha.
