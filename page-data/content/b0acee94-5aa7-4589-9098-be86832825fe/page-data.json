I wasn't at the main event itself, but I was there for both dinners and a lunch (hopefully not only invited so I would pay...).  But I had a <em>great</em> time talking to people I don't normally get a chance to.</li>\n<li>On Tuesday I had my last occupational health session at work, where I got a simple question, \"Are you feeling like yourself again?\" - and for the first time all year, the answer was a resounding yes.  I've been in a bit of a rut, and have felt anxious and stuck, but that's all over now — and I have the all-clear to start working out and travelling again, so I should probably take advantage of it.  Writing this particular point entirely for myself.</li>\n<li>Not sure why but I found this week particularly tiring.  I had a moment at the end of it, with George, where we just sat there in silence.  \"I'm exhausted\".</li>\n<li>Also met up for dinner with Hajime, who was in town for a big data conference.  Dinner was delicious: Enoteca de Luca, which I walk past at lest once a week.  On top of talking sports and business - we also talked about how much has changed in the five years since we worked together, yet also how little.</li>\n<li>I've started a new side-project: Vectorising this blog.  That's what I spent Saturday doing, before heading into town to have dinner and watch the people watching the Rugby.  Sunday included phenomenal Indian food with a side of wedding drama and a long walk around south london.</li>\n<li>Lxds this week was supposed to kick-off my exams for the month.  Only, when attempting to do the first one, it turned out that I wasn't registered for this exam ... or any of them.  Cue an urgent support ticket, and several phone calls.  I got it escalated to the office who handle exams, but, I haven't heard a thing and - well - now I've missed this exam.  Annoying.</li>\n<li>In reflection it's probably all the finals and the exam prep which left me so tired.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w38.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of Week 38 2023\" title=\"Collage of Week 38 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"One of my teams, Storytelling, ran a nice away-day - where everyone made it into London.
