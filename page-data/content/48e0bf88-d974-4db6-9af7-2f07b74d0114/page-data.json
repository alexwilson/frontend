As the two most established London teams, Customer Products &#x26; Internal Products combined our monthly team-wide showcases to welcome them. I’m glad we did it if only to see how different teams organise &#x26; run similar cultural events. And <em>so far</em> it’s already given rise to at least one inter-departmental table-tennis feud and/or tournament.</li>\n<li>As always, hugely impressive seeing the sheer skill of Japanese-English interpreters. Both during the snapshot, and later in an impromptu one-on-one, that is a level of multi-lingual mastery which needs to be seen to be believed. Meanwhile, nearly Wanikani level 3 - huzzah.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://alicebartlett.co.uk/\">Alice</a> started a book club at work, where <a href=\"https://medium.com/ft-product-technology/book-club-the-pragmatic-programmer-2886fe053ef\">we read a chapter of the revised Pragmatic Programmer and talk about it weekly</a>. First week was fun. My favourite note from the conversation was: <em>“Stone frog soup - what???”</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have you noticed that it’s rather warm lately?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last week Bloomberg took quite a bit of money from me, and tried to convince me I couldn’t ask for it back. After a mild email-based kerfuffle involving citing <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority\">CMA</a> guidance - I am pleased to report that I won. Know your rights folks. That was <em>air-conditioner</em> money.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://uk.switch-bot.com/\">Switchbot</a> have quietly expanded their uniquely lo-fi energy into other areas of home-automation, including the <a href=\"https://www.switch-bot.com/pages/switchbot-meter-plus\">Meter Plus</a> - which tracks humidity &#x26; temperature over time. It’s been uncomfortably warm in my apartment lately so I picked up a few to get a baseline.</li>\n<li>So far I’ve proved that indeed it is uncomfortably warm, but that like the central line in summer, it seems to be latent heat that I can’t quite shift. Any advice? Preferably that doesn’t involve buying an air conditioner?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There was a party and some other stuff, but talking about food feels more apt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On Friday I finally went to <a href=\"https://marugame.co.uk/\">Marugame</a> and it was <em>fantastic</em>. Curry udon with sides of brocoli &#x26; red pepper tempura for £10. I can see why it had such long queues when it opened - and paired with Koya - London suddenly seems like a nice place to be for udon.</li>\n<li>Oh and that is <em>such</em> a great deal compared to the “naughty child” ready-meal brand who on top of overcharging, <a href=\"https://soranews24.com/2020/02/12/the-u-k-thinks-japanese-curry-is-katsu-curry-and-people-arent-happy-about-it/\">popularised the wrong meaning of “katsu” for everybody in the UK</a>. Yes, it came up in conversation again this week. 😞</li>\n<li>Come to think of it, I went to <a href=\"https://www.koya.co.uk/restaurant/city/\">Koya</a> on Tuesday with L&#x26;T - and to <a href=\"https://ichibanya.uk/about/\">Coco Ichiban</a> today with my sister. Am I overcompensating for <a href=\"https://alexwilson.tech/content/dba70898-ee94-4ec8-b852-926630ce18f8\">last week’s over-eating of pizza</a>? What even is a balanced diet? These are all good questions - but I think it’s time to get my run on.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"This week at work felt quite heavy in terms of operational activities - it flew by and I had only really made progress in one discrete area…"},"slug":"/content/48e0bf88-d974-4db6-9af7-2f07b74d0114","deprecatedFields":{"legacySlugs":[]}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://alexwilson.tech"}}},"pageContext":{"contentId":"48e0bf88-d974-4db6-9af7-2f07b74d0114"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2931102475","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
