Lost at many board-games that I've never played before.  Lovely BBQ though.  Saw a fox trying to climb the wall.</li>\n<li>Doing the maths late one evening I figured out that I could save a lot of money by buying coffee and alcoholic beverages in-bulk.  So anyway, on Wednesday evening a crate of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocari_Sweat\">Pocari Sweat</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_Coffee\">Suntory Boss Coffee</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Zero\">Suntory Strong Zero</a> arrived.  For a relaxing time, make it Suntory time.</li>\n<li>Stayed late in the office on Friday, and ended up watching <a href=\"https://uxrconf23.joinlearners.com/\">UXRCon</a> with several researchers.  Pretty interesting stuff, I really enjoyed the different perspectives on examining personal and systemic biases in research.  I also really enjoyed most of the sponsor talks where they framed a sales-pitch for a product as a talk, and actually conveyed some pretty good stuff.  Don't get that at engineering conferences.</li>\n<li>With an upcoming trip, I played a lot of Zelda this weekend and started the perilous journey to unlock all of the <a href=\"https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/Lightroot\">Lightroots</a>.  There's so many of them!  So I gave up and did the Fire, Water and Wind temples instead.  Loving how expansive this game is: Even by BOTW standards it feels like it'll never end.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/2023-w23.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 23, 2023\" title=\"Collage of week 23, 2023\"></p>","excerpt":"It's air-con season again baby.
