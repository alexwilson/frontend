One bit stood out above the rest. “Find somewhere to live which reminds you that you’re in Japan”.  This week I moved into that place.  It’s within spitting distance of a centroid and from my window I can <em>just about</em> see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTT_Docomo_Yoyogi_Building\">NTT Docomo Yoyogi building</a>.</li>\n<li>There was some work stuff too this week, but I’ll spare you.</li>\n<li>The actual move was very, very easy.  Faster than last time.    The hard part was actually cleaning my last apartment (by my count, making it the third time this year!).</li>\n<li>I'll miss living in Azabu though.  It made me nostalgic for my flat in Sofia.</li>\n<li>Only trouble with moving in for the first time, during peak moving season, is that I own no furniture.  Zip.  Nothing.  Nada.</li>\n<li>So anyway, I’m temporarily sleeping on AB’s old futon.</li>\n<li>Bought some essentials: Blinds, towels, kettle and a hair dryer which looks &#x26; sounds like a Dyson Supersonic but definitely isn’t.</li>\n<li>Some reprieve at a Sushiro dinner (which was considerably more reasonably priced than last time) and a walk through a bustling Kanda.</li>\n<li>Unlike previous places I’ve lived, apartments here don’t come with white goods, and so Saturday was this week’s big fetch quest: As I walked between various stores, the heavens opened wide and unleashed all of April’s showers in one go, totally drenching me, my raincoat and my umbrella in the process.  This wouldn’t have been a problem had I not been shopping for a washing machine at the time.</li>\n<li>Yodobashi Akiba ended being my last resort, but with hindsight, it should’ve been my first call. The staff helped me make a bundle with several discounts, to schedule delivery and installation, and to somehow get extended warranty for free????  This was also a great opportunity for ポイ活.</li>\n<li>Met up with MP to visit Kamakura, Hasse and Enoshima — which make a great day trip.  Kamakura holds some special significance to me, because it is the place which re-taught me perspective in 2023.  Enoshima’s unfortunately named garden had a trippy, interactive art exhibition going on, set to the background music of modular synth.</li>\n<li>Seeing modular synth made me sad.  I still wish I had the time, space and money to get into it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w17-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 17, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 17, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"When leaving the UK, I got a lot of advice.
