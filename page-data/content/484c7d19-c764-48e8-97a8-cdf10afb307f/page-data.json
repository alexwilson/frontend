It's a brand new service built from the ground-up, featuring industry experts Lily Cole, Mary Schapiro, Paul Polman and Leo Strine who present educational courses on ESG (Environmental, Social &#x26; corporate-Governance).  The journey to get here has been really exciting and we've all learned a lot (\"write-ups pending\") - but if you'd like to learn from <em>these</em> brilliant people, you can get 20% off all courses using the promo code: <code class=\"language-text\">FTNETWORK</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>In other news</strong>: Several people from my old team were in town to meet up with each other in person for the first time since last year.  Since I left, several people have come and gone, but the dynamics and aura feel exactly the same and everybody is as lovely as I remembered.  One particularly emotional nostalgia-fuelled moment late in the week had me fighting back tears — a first for work — so that’s fun.  If any of you are reading this, including those who didn't make it this time, please come back soon: Drinks are on me.</li>\n<li><strong>In aaaaaAAAA-SO-AWKWARD news</strong>: This week marked another reminder of how brain glitches can ruin your day.  In particular those prompted by behavioural questions.  Previously I learned that &#x3C;8hrs sleep doesn't help and bringing the the STAR framework definitely does helps — however selecting the best examples and tuning the amount of detail to the audience seem to be things I just can’t stop tripping over.  I suppose this is probably now a big personal goal to try and resolve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay so what follows is an absolute cop-out because actually a tonne of other stuff happened but there’s one particular moment I’m (still) moderately angry about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scene: A (mostly) empty pub, after lunch</li>\n<li>“Hi, I'd like to order an Earl Grey tea please?”</li>\n<li>A few moments later was handed a mug brewing a bag of Twinings Earl Grey.  Fine?</li>\n<li>“Can I please also get some milk?”</li>\n<li>“One sec”</li>\n<li>Another few moments later, I was handed a small jug of milk.</li>\n<li>but it was STEAMED milk.  like, for a latte.</li>\n<li>WHAT.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, I guess fireworks season is upon us?</p>","excerpt":"This week felt somehow extra-significant?
