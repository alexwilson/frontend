This thing hit me hard. I'm glad that the NHS was there.</li>\n<li>The uncertainty of my symptoms led to something of an anxiety tailspin this week. It got <em>spookier</em>. And while I'm feeling far better now, this kind of thing is scary and can come on fast so - reminder that mental health is no joke.</li>\n<li>And did you know anxiety affects blood pressure?  I've seen the numbers, it's no joke.</li>\n<li>Alongside one therapy referral, I'm going through a slew of long-overdue tests with my GP.  In some countries there are annual physicals: For peace of mind I sorta wish we did them here.</li>\n<li>That beep? That fire alarms make when their several backup battery dies in the middle of the night? Yeah screw that beep. A sleepless night was the last thing I needed.
