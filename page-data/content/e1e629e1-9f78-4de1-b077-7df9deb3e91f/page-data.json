After a week of dribbling taps &#x26; spluttering shower-heads in England, the contrasting flow when I got home was the starkest and most visceral reminder that I wasn’t in England anymore.  I guess I was too tired to notice all the others.</li>\n<li>Monday was a <em>very</em> long day. I went for a run to get breakfast, did some work, and then headed to Paddington where I met Z and JW for a quick lemonade in the sun.  It started raining.  Heathrow was the fastest it’s ever been, I was at my gate in under 20 minutes.</li>\n<li>The direct plane journey back is no picnic: I napped but 14 hours is far too long and I regret not having a layover.  Managed 5 films, of which by far the most interesting was <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12299608\">Mickey 17 (2025)</a> which I’m giving a 3.5/5.  <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1745960/\">Top Gun Maverick (2024)</a> also gets 3.5/5 but in a different way.</li>\n<li>I have created a new question-bank for job interviews, building on my last one.  Each question is split by competency and level (although I need to better script follow-ups) and <a href=\"https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/interviewing-fairly.html\">scored with a rubric based on the 0-3 scale I learned from Anna</a>.</li>\n<li>Did you know you can get a push notification whenever <em>anyone</em> jumps out of a plane in Germany or in the UK?  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_transponder_codes\">Squawk codes</a> 0025 and 0033 respectively.  It was fun for a few minutes.  Turns out there’s a lot of parachuting in both countries.</li>\n<li>On average the air is at least 10 millibars lower in Tokyo than it is in London this time of year.  Travelling between the two mechanically changes your mood: A fall in air pressure results in increased serotonin release.</li>\n<li>After I received summons, CL ordered me the worst cocktail I’ve ever had, and now there are a bunch of compromising photos of me drinking it.  I think it was some kind of martini?  Otherwise a great evening with good people.  I learned a lot about overtime.</li>\n<li>The day after I answered different summons, and it more-or-less went the same way, only without any cocktails.  I learned less about overtime.</li>\n<li>Prompted by a storyline which has quietly percolated through recent notes, I’ve been writing and rewriting a small piece for myself, and I just can’t get it right.  It’s not something I will ever publish, but I’m still stuck somewhere between writer’s block and over-editing.  Tips on unsticking are welcome.</li>\n<li>The delta on rescheduling my trip is in, and it was 212, which is not bad for relatively last minute.  Thanks Azealia Banks.</li>\n<li>Spent a lot of time at the weekend in an outdoor cubby-hole working on a secret project, which has involved a lot of reading &#x26; talking.  It’s good: I’ve learned a lot about all aspects of the media industry, and I now have a road-map to learning more.</li>\n<li>So: Sunlight, tightly controlled food and coffee windows and a moderate amount of alcohol.  Have these helped regulate the jet-lag?  Not yet, but let’s see.</li>\n<li>Words matter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.alexwilson.tech/w30-2025.jpg\" alt=\"Collage of week 30, 2025\" title=\"Collage of week 30, 2025\"></p>","excerpt":"For me, it was the water pressure.
