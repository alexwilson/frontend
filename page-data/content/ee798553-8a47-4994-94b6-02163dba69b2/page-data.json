If there <em>was</em> a fire, they put it out so quickly we never even saw it.  The whole thing was awe-inspiring to watch.</li>\n<li>Z and I end up trying out 3C’s new dinner menu. It’s a strange model: Instead of hiring a chef, the bar seems to have sublet their kitchen to a family-run restaurant.  Their Pad Thai is decent.  CL drops by for a catch-up (and an ill-advised Instagram Video Call) that runs very late.</li>\n<li>Spend Saturday working a video-player side-project in Canary Wharf.  It’s probably my last time there for a bit and I’m really going to miss those views!</li>\n<li>Closed the week with a DIY Persian dinner watching one of my most anticipated movies: <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4978420/\">Borderlands (2024)</a>.  It was disappointing: I’d hoped they’d do something like translate the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands:_The_Handsome_Collection\">Handsome arc</a> to a one-shot film (imagine Ryan Reynolds as Jack!)  Instead the film was messy, strangely cast and visibly rushed - but it had <em>beautiful</em> visual effects: 2/5.</li>\n<li>Dinner slapped though: I make a mean olivier.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"We begin on a momentous day: the beginning of Pumpkin Spice season.
