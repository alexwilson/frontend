After getting a decent amount of positive, useful feedback while going through a number of recruitment processes, I was
keen to take the opportunity to get as much unbiased, objective feedback as I could while winding down and offboarding
from [Bluetel](https://bluetel.co.uk/).  As well as speaking to some people — including former-colleagues — about their
experiences with me over the years, I wanted something more regimented that I could compare against in the future.

Inspired by [Anna Shipman's excellent post](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/johari-window.html) on using a Johari
window to understand her strengths, I decided to try doing the same thing.  Against her advice, I decided to use a
Google form because I wanted to "own" my data.

On reflection it's entirely possible that this has biased my results, as it presents the options in a very linear
format!  Nonetheless I found a [very nice tool by Kevan](https://kevan.org/johari) which I recommend for future
exercises.

## What was my process?

I sent out the survey via Slack to 8 random colleagues — whom I'd worked with at some point over my 5½ years — hoping
to try and get as fair an assessment as possible.  I'm quite confident that this was the best way of going about it, as
only asking named individuals within a single team or two would have likely given feedback biased on factors unrelated
to my personality (such as perceived performance, which tends to be rather similar within a given team).

Of that 8, I received 5 (mostly) anonymous responses.  Then (without peeking!) I selected the six adjectives which I
felt best fit my personality from my own perspective, and after mapping, ended up with the following window.

## Results and takeaways

On the one-hand, these results are remarkably good! There's a trend towards more stoic personality traits which
reflect my core values and I hope have made a net-positive impression on people I've worked with.
_For now at least, this works wonders for my imposter syndrome._

On the other hand, two other values I felt like I had carefully internalised — Empathy and Helpfulness — did not come
up at all. It's possible that some of the ambiguity in the traits which _were_ identified alluded to the same thing,
however instead of dwelling on possibilities, I think that this simply marks an opportunity to better direct future
requests for feedback from the people I work with.  Then comparing future results against these in a few years time
perhaps I will come across a bit better.  Or perhaps I will have changed tact completely?

Overall the Johari window process has been hugely motivating and has shown me where and how I can continue to develop.
It's remarkable how much power a feedback process which _entirely_ excludes negativity can have, for personal growth!

I am glad to have gone through this exercise and strongly recommend you, dear reader, do the same.
