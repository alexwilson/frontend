With the backdrop of war in Ukraine &amp;#x26; exploring efforts to help, now feels like another time to compartmentalise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter has been full of some of the wildest content in years.  The irony of &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/256730a2-c09e-4319-ae77-239d05eaf15a&quot;&gt;writing this in weeknotes is palpable&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m truly impressed by people who’ve attempted to make the war about them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to suss out which side of the fence your late Russia-based Ukrainian family members would have come down on is emotionally ruinous.  I don’t think non-Russians understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/896181/putin-approval-rating-russia/&quot;&gt;how powerful &amp;#x26; effective state-run media is&lt;/a&gt;.  Independent journalism is vital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom line: There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/where-to-donate-to-support-ukrainian-civilians-in-and-outside-ukraine/&quot;&gt;huge influx of Ukrainian refugees who now need support, food &amp;#x26; shelter&lt;/a&gt;. Your employer may offer donation matching, and if so, definitely consider taking it.  Separately if you happen to be UK based, the government will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.actionaid.org.uk/donate/emergency/dec-ukraine-humanitarian-appeal&quot;&gt;match &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; charitable donations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compartmentalising? Well that’s made &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; by continuing to avoid social media, sort-of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/8d7e40da-0cf3-453e-9eb3-40036d4e2582&quot;&gt;Commutes this week weren’t great&lt;/a&gt;, however in some ways I’d come to miss the chaos. More I’m looking forward to a time when office routine won’t feel like a big novelty worth reporting on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Raspberry Pi turned 10 last week and to celebrate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/video/c6568ace-0da3-49bf-92d2-2b27ef4ef055&quot;&gt;the FT ran an 18 minute video-essay&lt;/a&gt;, it’s pretty good, and guest-stars &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;one of - just - the best people&lt;/a&gt;.  Also the Pi Zero 2 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; out of stock&lt;/a&gt;. ☹️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Netflix News: The finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11704040&quot;&gt;Love Is Blind&lt;/a&gt; was suitably awkward - but, the drama hasn’t concluded and now there’s a proper feud between some of the cast on Instagram.  Oh, also, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14992922/&quot;&gt;The Tinder Swindler&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good — although this recent wave of true-ish crime releases on Netflix doesn’t exactly make for the most uplifting content!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brandon Sanderson &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a-k6eaT-jQ&quot;&gt;announced a new novel&lt;/a&gt; and broke Kickstarter which is kinda cool I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved back to &lt;em&gt;RSS-by-default&lt;/em&gt;, Trying to mimic the nostalgia of how I read the internet in 2013:  Before “doom-scrolling” existed in the zeitgeist, and, before social media firms spent millions perfecting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS-by-default is nice.  &lt;em&gt;Sort-of&lt;/em&gt;.  Before this when I followed only a few blogs - basic clients were enough — However, now I get to experience the varied quality of different feeds &amp;#x26; clients.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reederapp.com/&quot;&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;http://lireapp.com/&quot;&gt;Lire&lt;/a&gt; are the the best cross-platform Apple options I’ve found so far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimising my reader’s quality-to-quantity balance, I tried sending newsletters to it.  For some busier sites, the regular human curation &amp;#x26; summarisation is far more readable than a standard firehose feed.  A side-benefit is that I can now follow Substack/Twitter publications!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purely anecdotally, I’m already reading more mindfully.  The distance between me &amp;#x26; algorithmic curation is teaching me to move beyond &lt;em&gt;engagement&lt;/em&gt; towards &lt;em&gt;understanding&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Separately there were some significant updates &amp;#x26; happenings to talk about, but today I debated posting anything at all.  Being both Ukrainian &amp;#x26; Russian by blood &amp;#x26; family I cannot be entirely silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History and culture are products of real-world, lived experience.  One doesn’t normally become an expert on &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; occupations and conflicts by reading the odd article, and - this is no exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially right now you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; pay caution to what you read, watch and think.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookdown.org/rlridenour/ct-text/&quot;&gt;Be deeply skeptical&lt;/a&gt;, especially of short/punchy views.  Russia &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures&quot;&gt;practically invented the misinformation game&lt;/a&gt;.  In fact, the Kremlin’s incumbents notably rekindled it.  In turn other superpowers have begun playing by the same rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I’m really saying here is - if you’ve got an opinion and aren’t based in Eastern Europe, you’re best off not sharing it because in the &lt;em&gt;best case&lt;/em&gt; it’s a distraction, and in the &lt;em&gt;worst case&lt;/em&gt; it’s actively pushing propaganda.  Both cases, it’s offensive: So let’s focus on only re-sharing information that saves lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can you do?  Well: Money (unfortunately) speaks louder than words, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/Help-Ukraine-9a92bc1e949747648104d1e1d284d7e3&quot;&gt;donating will go a long way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side-note: Released this week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11893274/&quot;&gt;Downfall (2022)&lt;/a&gt; is an incredibly important documentary: Greed kills.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Remember the milk? — 20th February 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hah, it's 2022-02-20.

If there&apos;s anything I learned from Imgur in the past, is that numbers like this are significant because, like, it has a bunch of 0s and 2s in it. /s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the weekend I caved to the peer pressure and started watching Love is Blind.  I can’t tell if the editing is just like - really good - or if this cast of characters are genuinely this erratic &amp;#x26; incompatible.  It&apos;s all &lt;a href=&quot;https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/69/&quot;&gt;Rowan&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Alice&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; fault.  If you&apos;re reading this and also watch it, please shout: I&apos;d love to more evenly unload all of the cringe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m going through another K-pop phase.  Eventually if I listen to enough k-pop I&apos;ll become as cool as a member of BTS, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7eAVvddZJyW9wYjzSrVlhu?si=7f7c08a047ce45a9&quot;&gt;that&apos;s how it works right&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whoops, I was supposed to do something about fixing web-mentions this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I overexerted myself by doing too much far too quickly, and on Friday was left genuinely emotionally exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foolishly I went directly from 2 days in the office to 4. In the before-times I was doing 5, so what&apos;s different now?  Well: Thursday commutes are severely unpleasant.  And &lt;em&gt;every-day&lt;/em&gt; there&apos;s a low-to-medium level mixture of social-anxiety &amp;#x26; viral-anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I only went in on Thursday because they switched off the water in my building. Annoying.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a few time-sensitive activities happening right now and several of my team being away for reasons of half-term &amp;#x26; illness, I didn&apos;t leave any slack in my schedule. So when a few urgent problems arose I was caught off-guard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cherry on top is that I took a bunch of emotional labour and wore myself out. There&apos;s severe dissonance between popular positivity and denial and the general languish which many are still feeling.  We all need holidays.  Real ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very early into Animal Farm an entire pail of milk disappears from the freshly liberated farm. While Orwell makes this event incredibly conspicuous, it&apos;s never directly explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To an English teacher, this is foreshadowing: It primes the reader by pre-empting the future.  Surely it couldn&apos;t have been the pigs?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To an analyst: It&apos;s a strong signal that there&apos;s something going on. Maybe time to take a closer look at these pigs, huh?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To a trader: Feeling bullish about milk lxds - going all in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a roundabout way of saying it, but, pay attention to the signals people.  You&apos;re not supposed to feel that drained on a Friday.   Keep a gratitude journal.  Take a holiday.  Oh, and don&apos;t trust &lt;del&gt;capitalist&lt;/del&gt; pigs skimming the cream &lt;del&gt;of your labour&lt;/del&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Nice-yet-bland — 13th February 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[Brief spells of rain punctuate slightly longer days — seemingly timed to coincide with whenever I step outside.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the years I’ve come to recognise this as a sign that spring is well and truly on the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For most this time of year means recanting resolutions and thinking about spring cleaning.  For me it means obtaining an umbrella.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year it’s a nice-yet-bland number &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.totes.co.uk/details.aspx?pid=39642&quot;&gt;from totes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week it was nice participating in an technology strategy workshop in person, in an actual meeting room. (&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This wording is borrowed since it really stuck with me&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/68/&quot;&gt;Rowan mentions sharing some documentation with me&lt;/a&gt;.  For the court, I’d like to clarify that said documentation included a recipe for making (very good) kimchi fried rice.  Thanks Rowan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not miss the ever-present threat of train delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burying some lede, also this week, I got frustrated at having a fringe and cut my own hair. No that’s it. That’s all I’m saying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week has also been strangely contemplative as I&apos;ve been trying to process some complex thoughts and feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That includes taking a short sort-of-break from Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it&apos;s okay, it means extra time to read Noam Chomsky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I sort-of long for 19th century coffee-houses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wohl&quot;&gt;Richard Wohl&lt;/a&gt; (1921-1957) was ahead of his time.&lt;/li&gt;

That crept up quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of my spare time this month went towards ... mid-terms and &lt;em&gt;recovering from&lt;/em&gt; mid-terms.  Tight deadlines are one thing: Vague rubrics that surprise you with nuance are another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither published yet but I also managed to write some software (in Swift) and some words (in plain English).  Both activities feel novel and rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of the month I joined a new team at work, which (amongst many other things) has involved learning about different domains, meeting new people and becoming ever-so-slightly overwhelmed at the new number of things going on.  It’s pretty great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/20bf537b-e7c7-45f5-be35-35f3e1b2b586&quot;&gt;my review of 2021&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about not trying to languages without enrolling in a school (for accountability &amp;#x26; realism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, life’s full of surprises and something totally unexpected happened: My regular scheduled programme of doom-scrolling through Twitter was interrupted by The Algorithm recommending Tweets in Russian.  Like, technologist humor and general slice-of-life content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I understood enough of it (save for the occasional word and/or grammatical aberration) that I’ve now begun reading some short-form in Russian.  Less combining individual letters and more scanning words.  Neat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honestly just wanted to tell someone about this because it feels like a switch has finally been flipped in my brain: Although the real lesson here is that Twitter’s algorithm is becoming increasingly creepy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the chess front I’ve been trying to do a bit of a deep-dive in learning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chess.com/openings/London-System&quot;&gt;The London System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, fine, sure, it’s a meme, whatever you say dude.  I like it a lot because it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31235838-the-agile-london-system&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;remarkably&lt;/em&gt; well documented&lt;/a&gt; beginner-friendly opening with logical variations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning variations is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. It requires more concentration than actually playing a game of chess and annoyingly it’s additive: Understanding every step of how you arrive at a position is core to understanding what you do next.  If one of those pieces isn’t quite there, things get really difficult really quickly.  If there’s a better way I’m all ears!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far my progress is hard to measure.  Against bots (&lt;em&gt;humans are scary!&lt;/em&gt;) I’m usually interrupted before I can commit to a meaningful variation.  Grr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[2021 In Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[It feels like only yesterday we were celebrating the end of 2020, a year which frankly defied expectations.

For many, we saw a light at the end of the tunnel in Spring of ‘21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However as many sensible people cautioned us: This current era is a marathon, not a sprint.  For me 2021 was when I hit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall&quot;&gt;the wall&lt;/a&gt;, a few tricky experiences (arising from lockdown &amp;#x26; remote-everything!) genuinely hurt - but I’ve moved on.  Oh, and along the way I also somehow killed a bonsai tree. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year felt long, and yet now in retrospect feels incredibly short - but there’s a lot to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Headlines&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resumed writing week-notes again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Released a track to a bunch of stores/platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read 100 books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gave a talk at an internal tech conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaped &amp;#x26; shipped some big-ticket products at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started a secret project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metroid Dread!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largely this year involved less technical learning than earlier years.  In 2020 I helped my team re-platform some &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/d1a4a7bb-fc4d-41f2-8482-8a7afe1af0e6&quot;&gt;large chunks of legacy technology&lt;/a&gt; into microservices with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/&quot;&gt;island architecture&lt;/a&gt; on the front-end.  Along the way I began working with TypeScript, edge-computing and building “test-in-prod” safe production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2021 has been largely the same, with the addition of bringing some machine-learning and natural-language-processing tooling in to begin understanding the meaning of some content.  That has been by design: My area has been attempting to build quickly and learn from customers which has meant leaning on better known technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021 I started using AWS CDK for some side-projects and started building a few personal helper utilities.  Most of my learning has been directed towards data platforms &amp;#x26; product-management practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; sure where to focus my efforts in 2022 yet, although this will likely emerge later in the year.  (Some people are learning Rust - picking that back up might be fun?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year I joined a new team called “Professional” which had a mission to build new products and to begin improving the B2B offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m quite proud of what we achieved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In May, we shipped &lt;a href=&quot;https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/&quot;&gt;Enterprise Sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In September, we launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://expert-series.ft.com/&quot;&gt;Expert Series&lt;/a&gt;, a new service initially specialising in environmental, social &amp;#x26; corporate governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In November, we released &lt;a href=&quot;https://lumen.ft.com/&quot;&gt;ESG Lumen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We implemented “MVP” product analytics across each, and later began moving towards a more integrated product-analytics workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the year went on, we began sharing platform components including a content-delivery-network and a feature-flagging &amp;#x26; cohort-allocation utility (which performs ludicrously well at scale!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are also several exciting other experiments in-progress, including a chatbot!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of my team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I gave an internal conference talk reflecting on some experiences in Nikkei Asia.  Generally the feedback was good, and with some polish this might be a good talk for external audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent time working on an internal technology-vision project focussing on 2030 with colleagues in London, San Francisco and Tokyo.  The end-conclusion was quite interesting and it really reinforced how tightly market opportunities &amp;#x26; technology are coupled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team’s journey over the year was one of convergence: We began by diverging (picking our own stack, tools, data platform, etc..) to optimise for autonomy.  Later we began re-converging to benefit from the work of other teams.  It’s genuinely hard to say which is better for lean product development, but overall I’m pretty thrilled that we could adapt our approach in the same lean manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the year, while I won’t reflect on these experiences too closely, I feel like I grew both as an engineering manager and as an individual contributor although I really found recruitment challenging this year: That part was brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I had hoped to get some experience working in a Product Management role, and while I learned a lot more about the process, unfortunately it didn’t happen.  I realised that this is something I’m deeply passionate about and will attempt to explore in more depth at a later point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 I’m moving to a new team: Customer Products, who are responsible for &lt;a href=&quot;http://FT.com&quot;&gt;FT.com&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; the apps.  While it’s really hard saying goodbye (but not farewell!) to my current team, I’m really excited about what 2022 &amp;#x26; Customer Products hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/bracken-at-christmas.jpg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A christmas tree at the office&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Offices&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/1843/2020/04/29/death-of-the-office&quot;&gt;everybody seems&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2021/11/23/office-friendship/&quot;&gt;have an opinion&lt;/a&gt; on offices and I&apos;m fairly sure far too many people have heard my own ever-changing views... (&lt;em&gt;fairly sure that I’ve alienated a few - if you’re one of these people, sorry!&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said - throughout both 2020 &amp;#x26; 2021, while going to an office was an &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt;, I found it genuinely helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The routine really helped.  Going to a place physically separate to home helps me contextualise and focus, and later-on, to detach from work more easily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When quiet, offices can be great places to focus.  Like, really really good.  Like, &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a managerial &amp;#x26; leadership context, some activities &amp;#x26; conversations are genuinely far easier in person: Gone are the unreliability of calls, and you should still bring techniques for ensuring fair representation in meetings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spontaneous mid &amp;#x26; after work socials can be lovely. They genuinely help break down silos and share knowledge/opportunities - in digital tooling we rarely connect with people we aren’t immediately working with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However something interesting happened in 2021 as the office and the City of London started to become a bit busier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commutes can be painful, especially on a busy underground line: Offset working hours, allowing one to avoid the chaos, are fantastic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes people join meetings from a room which tips the balance of a meeting. The room starts to dominate the conversation. In these cases joining from a laptop seems un-intuitive but is deeply respectful. However most offices don&apos;t have good one-person meeting spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True open-plan settings become distracting as they fill up, more people working-on and talking-about many different things are fairly distracting.  I&apos;ve both been this person - causing an inevitable distraction (yikes, SORRY!) - and simultaneously been seeking out secret quiet spots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursdays are truly, &lt;strong&gt;truly&lt;/strong&gt; awful.  It&apos;s the peak working day, by far the busiest, for most of the City of London &amp;#x26; I hope to avoid as many of these as I can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 a study found that &lt;em&gt;unstructured&lt;/em&gt; open-offices aren&apos;t as helpful as people assume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The volume of face-to-face interaction decreased significantly (approximately 70%) . . . with an associated increase in electronic interaction.”&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2017.0239&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as many start to bring in hybrid-working patterns, my hope for 2022 is that technology companies won’t bring in a highly structured approach requiring staggered presence of disciplines on particular days (flexibility rocks!). Rather, I hope we&apos;ll instead see movement towards a “co-location of purpose” approach: Where groups can sit near one-another across functions, not constrained to a particular discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Music&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic, in 2020 I planned to resume DJing.  It was originally for fun, but in the early isolation of the first lockdown, having a creative outlet proved incredibly liberating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However that was only part of the plan - I also wanted to make music, and for many reasons around having far too much to do, it didn’t happen.  This year it did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project is called “AXWN” — a contraction of “Alex Wilson”, pronounced &lt;em&gt;ak.soːn&lt;/em&gt; - and under AXWN I both play &amp;#x26; produce techno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techno has simple building blocks - a 4/4 beat, a kick-drum, some percussion and maybe a synth - allowing some of my favourite artists to be hugely expressive.  Simple enough to make something good, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things always seem simple until you start learning about the process.  It involved getting to grips with the different components of a track, mixing so that everything sounds correct, arrangement, and the basics of sound design.  I finally had an excuse to start learning about synthesis which - is genuinely fascinating.  I watched &amp;#x26; read a lot of material on the topic, but this interview by Wendy Carlos in 1989 for BBC 2 really stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time working on music passes by really, really quickly.  Quicker than during the bursts of hyper-focus I get while writing code or with other hobbies.  Since music is a series of events happening over time, the only way really check your work is to listen - and so 30 seconds on repeat suddenly became minutes, and before I knew it, hours...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of tracks that I’ve been noodling on for several months now.  This, which I actually started the Ableton project for in 2020, is still heavily work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I really wanted to ship something, and so in December I had a project combining several fun ideas I’d discovered over the year, which I then mastered and shipped.  It’s called “Space Dragon On The Go” - the name came quite late into the process, but it seemed to fit and so stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1172538274&amp;color=%236e16b1&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic&quot; title=&quot;AXWN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;AXWN&lt;/a&gt; · &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/space-dragon-on-the-go&quot; title=&quot;AXWN - Space Dragon On The Go&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;&quot;&gt;AXWN - Space Dragon On The Go&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s available on pretty much all streaming platforms and for sale on Bandcamp &amp;#x26; Apple Music.  I’d really appreciate any support or feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year I’m definitely continuing this journey, and after finishing a few more projects I really want to try and produce an entire album.  I’d also quite like to learn classical piano - there are a few things I regret about my childhood, but missing the multiple opportunities to learn piano ranks near the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chess&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and I picked chess back up.  My puzzle-rating on chess.com is something like 1400 -  but my actual rating is still pretty bad.  (To be fair: I haven’t played many rated games against real humans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/chessboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A chessboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIDE tournaments have been genuinely nail-biting to watch and - while it requires a lot of effort to understand the commentary- they’ve been a really great way of relaxing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 I really want to continue this journey.  I’d like to develop my skills playing against human opponents and actually join a chess club, starting with the English Chess Federation.  If I find the extra funds, I may also try and get a chess coach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reading &amp;#x26; Writing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of not touching a single novel (Ready Player One &amp;#x26; The Phoenix Project don’t count), last year helped me rediscover that I actually really enjoy fiction.  And taking time away from screens to read has actually been pretty thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, I set myself the totally arbitrary target of reading 100 books.  Having just completed that, I’ve managed to go through a wide mixture of books including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of Junji Ito’s works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not enough of Brandon Sanderson novels (they’re so good!9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprisingly many non-fiction books about hypernormalisation, media manipulation &amp;#x26; active-measures.  Wow, cheery stuff Alex!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some stuff about architecture (buildings, not software, honest!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less surprisingly, a few books about chess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side-note, I&apos;m always looking for good book recommendations and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90636253-alex-wilson&quot;&gt;would love to connect via Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/goodreads-100-2021.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Via goodreads, 100/100 books read.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where this section pivots to writing.  Quickly I realised that by starting to read so much, I totally tipped the input/output balance off-scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I began journalling, for myself.  My format is based on bullet-journalling, which I used to do extensively in the past, but is less task-oriented and 100% digital.  (&lt;em&gt;I stopped bullet-journaling because I lost a pen-lid!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Occasionally I now write longer-form essays when I’m wrestling with decisions or reflecting on difficult times.  Part accountability and part therapy, it’s allowed me to avoid buyer’s remorse when looking at my decision-making process, and to share with others for input.  I’ve found that it’s easier to be vulnerable in writing, and by borrowing techniques like expressive writing it’s possible to do this quite constructively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rowanmanning.com/&quot;&gt;Rowan&lt;/a&gt; nudged me to resume writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/topic/weeknotes&quot;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;, and so I gave it a go.  They are entirely public, and to avoid building an unsustainable practice, I’ve decided it’s okay to take breaks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/278059da-8c59-4a6e-8992-1530f9630ab8&quot;&gt;streaks aren’t healthy motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’d like to do more of in 2022 is to start writing more publicly - for me.  There are a few reasons I haven’t got around to doing this, between confidence &amp;#x26; prioritisation, but I now have a lengthy list of ideas &amp;#x26; half-written abstracts and some tips on a writing workflow.  Hopefully that’ll be something to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Who knows, maybe I’ll also start trying to do more public speaking - but one thing at a time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Languages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has this ever happened to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, Alex, you speak Russian?”&lt;br /&gt;
”Well, I’m permanently rusty because I speak it so rarely. But after a few days of exposure I’m pretty fluent.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Can you say something?”&lt;br /&gt;
“nyet”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, reader, it happens to me far too often.  In trying to reconnect with my Russian heritage this year I also hoped to improve my Russian.  I made it as far as re-learning reading &amp;#x26; writing the alphabet, and later started watching Russian comedy. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D1%83%D1%85%D0%BD%D1%8F_(%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB)&quot;&gt;Кухня&lt;/a&gt; - it’s rather good, and has an entire cinematic universe!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think that trying to learn a language without a teacher and/or people to speak it with is really, really difficult.  In retrospect this is why I stopped learning Japanese in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels a little arrogant of us to assume that by downloading hot-new-language app X we’re be approaching a speaking/listening level of competence in another language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as there is time &amp;#x26; space, since I genuinely &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; Russian, Japanese and German, I will try to find opportunities to join a language school, or tutor/tutor group.  This is a years-long goal, one language at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sobriety&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year I decided to quit drinking outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few months of trying to do this and still socialise, I learned that remaining lucid around people achieving new heights of inebriation can be rather uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I caved, and started trying to find approaches to drink socially, starting with “wine-only” and going through a few iterations (including “half-pints only” - very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dangerous)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway here’s roughly where I got to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bringing a decaf-coffee and maybe ordering some tea is totally okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water is cheaper than “alcohol-free beer” and usually tastes better too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving early limits how much you can drink - and - buys a little extra time to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller groups with meaningful conversation tend to dilute even the strongest rakia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dinner with drinks is always better than drinks followed by dinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really though I’m looking forward to when more non-alcohol-centric opportunities to socialise become more viable.  Going for walks &amp;#x26; grabbing coffee with people this year was generally lovely - but finding other activities (including, I guess, chess?) would be nice too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about 2022?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I set a few goals via quarterly personal OKRs which worked relatively well, and this might be a sensible way to frame more concrete objectives, however I’m not going to attempt to set anything specific yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, inspired by the theme system, there are three themes which have emerged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creative work (difficult, but so fulfilling &amp;#x26; rewarding)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start writing &amp;#x26; composing music more. At one point I was good at drawing, too, but right now it seems like a distraction.  I would like, however, to produce an album - and ideally to start learning classical piano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Belonging &amp;#x26; wellbeing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lockdown has taken a toll on my mental health - not directly, but the small things such as repeated isolation and low-level anxiety.  I found distance from people I care about really contributed towards rejection sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 I’d like to try and find a “third-place”, something I lost in 2020, to provide distance from both home &amp;#x26; work.  Perhaps this comes from technology, music, chess, video-games or any number of other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to find sustainable ways of living which don’t damage my health - and try to improve it.  Historically I’ve focussed on weight alone - but this isn’t constructive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With spring rapidly approaching, between walking &amp;#x26; travelling, I’m hoping to find some of the novelty the past two years have hidden away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Figuring out “What’s next”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 and 2021 I was quite lucky and managed to meet several career goals, however by focussing on a few specific areas and prioritising these I may have made more meaningful progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the move to a new team in 2022 and the realisation that I want to spend some time in a Product Management role, I want to walk away from 2022 with a better understanding of where I stand and a (vague) career plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has made it this far, I wish you a very happy 2022.  Things may get weird but you can do it.  Or at least, that&apos;s what I keep telling myself.  And that&apos;s a wrap, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: The most wonderful time of the year — 19th December 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[The last working week of the year and I'm not sure where it went.

I&apos;ve started writing a proper introspective post about the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I released my first track!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s called “Space Dragon On The Go”.  Not really sure where the name came from, but it stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The release process itself has been really interesting, and it turns out to be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard. Lots of juggling and I&apos;m left with even more respect for people who do this all the time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It isn&apos;t my best work - but I&apos;m proud of having finished &amp;#x26; released something, end-to-end, this year. There are something like six tracks in progress right now and I&apos;m stuck obsessing over details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still trying to find &quot;my sound&quot;.  This is &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt; between minimal &amp;#x26; melodic techno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said, it&apos;s also definitely a little bit over-engineered. There are a lot of cool things you can do in music production and here I&apos;ve applied a few cool tricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can find it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://axwn.bandcamp.com/track/space-dragon-on-the-go&quot;&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/space-dragon-on-the-go&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/0VFuVParkP62YrwmypWKIE?si=5124eacded3f4bab&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; most of the other streaming platforms!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&apos;d really appreciate likes, follows &amp;#x26; reposts.  Of course - if it&apos;s not your jam - that&apos;s fair too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally the plan was to write this while staying with family for Christmas...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A week and a half ago, that still seemed quite reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But then pandemic numbers started climbing...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And then the &quot;pings&quot; from the NHS contact-tracing started coming...  (Despite not going out much! What!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last social of the year (Tuesday) quickly pivoted to a remote one.  Naturally, Jackbox 3-6 were featured prominently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then about three hours before the train, during our traditional departmental watch-a-long of Die Hard...  (it&apos;s a christmas movie, damnit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A close member of family tested positive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cue a weekend of worry: It&apos;s hard being so far away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It put a bit of a dampener on Die Hard.  (&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a christmas movie, damnit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway Christmas is &lt;del&gt;cancelled&lt;/del&gt; &lt;em&gt;postponed indefinitely&lt;/em&gt;, for the second year in a row.  Ah well.  Time to catch-up with coursework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you, dear reader, are safe &amp;#x26; well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Boosted — 12th December 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ah yes, December.

&lt;li&gt;Thankfully nobody has played &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dogen/status/1072108595137794048&quot;&gt;Last Christmas by Wham&lt;/a&gt; yet.  Yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole Log4j thing is a bit of a mess isn&apos;t it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howoldisnick.com/&quot;&gt;Happy Birthday &lt;del&gt;Harry&lt;/del&gt; Nick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hit a 1370 puzzle rating on chess.com.  If only that corresponded to my ability to play.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh it&apos;s the twelfth.  It&apos;s probably too late to start with Advent of Code now, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few working weeks of the year, I&apos;ve begun making the annual pilgrimage to the summit of admin mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Admin has otherwise been a major theme of my work this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&apos;ve spent the past few weeks really honing our new product development process to bake in everything we learned this year - from recruitment to team processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Including baking in better engineering-led quality processes, ranging from testing to accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And on an accessibility-kick, bringing captions to Expert Series was pretty rewarding work this week.  I really regret not doing this sooner because it would have been far easier.  But in the spirit of continuous improvement we&apos;ve added light-touch transcription to the video production process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But anyway, I kind-of made the admin workload harder because...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January I&apos;m joining a new team - Customer Products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(That&apos;s the bit of the FT who build FT.com &amp;#x26; the mobile apps)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s a good time to join: As well as helping answer questions about how teams &amp;#x26; products should work together, there&apos;s some pretty bold new product &amp;#x26; technology objectives which pose some fascinating technology challenges around architecture &amp;#x26; scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And I&apos;m equal measures excited and nervous. In some ways it&apos;ll be quite different - on the flip-side it means working with some pretty remarkable people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Products, my soon-to-be-previous team Enterprise &amp;#x26; other parts of the FT are all hiring: &lt;a href=&quot;https://roles.ft.com/&quot;&gt;Come join us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a booster vaccine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After hearing that the NHS had silently allowed people in my age-group to get them, on Friday &amp;#x26; Saturday I went to a few walk-in sites but got there too late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today I walked down the road to Roehampton - and with no queue was in-and-out in about 20 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&apos;re reading this in the UK - if three months have passed since your last dose, you&apos;re probably eligible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now if only the passport renewal process would complete faster...&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.computer/&quot;&gt;Kara&lt;/a&gt; gave an exceptional introduction into modular synthesis (including a live-demo) which was a real stand-out.  She had a point-of-view set-up reminiscent of some of my favourite YouTubers, but, much unlike them she had designed something that was much more beginner-friendly - including a smaller rack with fewer modules &amp;#x26; colour-coded patch cables, all very nice touches. The slow campaign to persuade more people over to techno, synthesis and production is making steady progress - congrats Kara!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was also a quiz which was definitely rigged.  Or, er, at least I lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I gave a new talk titled “The Magic Button”, reflecting on a difficult time several years ago where my team made some mistakes, what we did about them &amp;#x26; what we learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final-polish sprint running up to my slot was “fun” as always. I went through all five stages of preparing a talk: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Melodramatic Nervousness and Deliverance. Right before taking the stage, for a second, I actually froze up. Apparently nobody noticed it, but in that moment I felt eternity: That&apos;s a first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s difficult talking openly about difficult times: In the industry there&apos;s usually so much success spin in talks where we filter-out or redress our (inevitable!) mistakes. I hope at least one person walked away hearing that it&apos;s okay to make large mistakes — what&apos;s more important is how we respond to them. With some pacing adjustments, I might try to deliver this to external audiences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approach the end of the year, time feels like it has really sped up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The days are getting shorter - working from home it&apos;s now a little harder to catch the sunlight. Not ideal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s a lot I need to get done both at home &amp;#x26; at work over the next few weeks. In giving a talk I seriously worried that I&apos;d overcommitted — so I&apos;m glad I followed through with it, but, the remaining major tasks for the rest of the year are all a little less optional. Please wish me luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relatedly, without reflecting on omnicron &amp;#x26; the wave of anxiety it&apos;s summoned back up, I am suddenly regretting not renewing my passport sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend, for the first time ever, I&apos;ve been watching the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chess.com/article/view/world-chess-championship-2021&quot;&gt;FIDE World Championship&lt;/a&gt;. It&apos;s definitely a different pace to other sporting events I&apos;ve followed — none of the mayhem of &lt;a href=&quot;https://npb.jp/eng/&quot;&gt;NPB&lt;/a&gt; or the energy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fifa.com/&quot;&gt;FIFA&lt;/a&gt; — but the same palpable tension. These chess games are a bit slower yet very deliberate and both the official &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chess.com&quot;&gt;chess.com&lt;/a&gt; commentaries have helped me really understand what is going on. Somehow it feels like the right level of energy after this week &amp;#x26; something I hope to continue following for years to come.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes:  Taking Stock — 14th November 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Reader, we're six weeks away from the end of 2021.

How did &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; happen?  It was March 2020 not that long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work I feel like my team is starting to make a lot of progress quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess now that half-term is over, we&apos;re in the last &quot;sprint&quot; of the year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few initiatives on my plate have sped up which makes them harder to balance, but, that&apos;s a good thing because it&apos;s nudged me to change tact in some and delegate a little more in others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particularly exciting is planning the change/removal of a few bits of consistent process &amp;#x26; technology debt which we&apos;ve previously worked around the hard way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were optimising locally a lot: Solving problems per-team and sharing notes, but not giving reusable solutions. Ignoring hindsight bias, I still think it was the best thing to do at the time (giving small teams much more autonomy) but it&apos;s really refreshing looking forward at the slightly bigger picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really I&apos;m just thrilled to see things coming together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday I was offered an exciting opportunity which originally, I thought would be a no-brainer. It&apos;s been sitting with me all week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexkondov.com/&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; would remind me that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/341035-we-suffer-more-often-in-imagination-than-in-reality&quot;&gt;“We suffer much more in imagination than reality”&lt;/a&gt;, and I know that it&apos;s right?  But, &lt;em&gt;still...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experience has encouraged me to revisit my (vague) career goals, which is always a good thing.  That&apos;s where this post title comes from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole exercise has helped me understand that my desire to move (temporarily, but who knows?) from engineering into product management is much more than a desire and — if nothing else — that is something I wish I&apos;d realised much sooner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an engineer I&apos;m personally motivated by disparate problem-areas and love deep-dives into problems across domains and technology - which is probably why I&apos;ve become &quot;full-stack&quot;?  Some time ago I learned that the behavioural pattern of returning to horizontal-problem spaces so frequently aligns me closest to a generalist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So far this all tracks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally though as we approach December, people are beginning to introspect on the year.  The yearnotes posts which have appeared so far are fantastic — it&apos;s really cool seeing how much people have done.  Between starting with this exercise &amp;#x26; having a healthy amount of time booked away in December ... another thing to do, hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend also marked the point of me finishing my first track to the point where I&apos;m relatively happy to share it.  While I wait to gather some feedback, I made the mistake of looking into how music distribution works...  The short answer is that (even for free) it involves printing &amp;#x26; signing a lot of international tax forms.  Huzzah for bureaucracy &amp;#x26; paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Steamed Tea — 7th November 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[This week felt somehow extra-significant?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In incredibly exciting news&lt;/strong&gt;: My team shipped a new product! &lt;a href=&quot;https://expert-series.ft.com/&quot;&gt;FT Expert Series&lt;/a&gt;.  It&apos;s a brand new service built from the ground-up, featuring industry experts Lily Cole, Mary Schapiro, Paul Polman and Leo Strine who present educational courses on ESG (Environmental, Social &amp;#x26; corporate-Governance).  The journey to get here has been really exciting and we&apos;ve all learned a lot (&quot;write-ups pending&quot;) - but if you&apos;d like to learn from &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; brilliant people, you can get 20% off all courses using the promo code: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;FTNETWORK&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In other news&lt;/strong&gt;: Several people from my old team were in town to meet up with each other in person for the first time since last year.  Since I left, several people have come and gone, but the dynamics and aura feel exactly the same and everybody is as lovely as I remembered.  One particularly emotional nostalgia-fuelled moment late in the week had me fighting back tears — a first for work — so that’s fun.  If any of you are reading this, including those who didn&apos;t make it this time, please come back soon: Drinks are on me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In aaaaaAAAA-SO-AWKWARD news&lt;/strong&gt;: This week marked another reminder of how brain glitches can ruin your day.  In particular those prompted by behavioural questions.  Previously I learned that &amp;#x3C;8hrs sleep doesn&apos;t help and bringing the the STAR framework definitely does helps — however selecting the best examples and tuning the amount of detail to the audience seem to be things I just can’t stop tripping over.  I suppose this is probably now a big personal goal to try and resolve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so what follows is an absolute cop-out because actually a tonne of other stuff happened but there’s one particular moment I’m (still) moderately angry about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scene: A (mostly) empty pub, after lunch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Hi, I&apos;d like to order an Earl Grey tea please?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few moments later was handed a mug brewing a bag of Twinings Earl Grey.  Fine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Can I please also get some milk?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“One sec”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another few moments later, I was handed a small jug of milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but it was STEAMED milk.  like, for a latte.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WHAT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I guess fireworks season is upon us?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes:  Space — 24th October 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week Nick helped me move my standing desk from Whitechapel, which was quite the adventure across London. ... and this week I got a…]]></description><link>https:/alexwilson.tech/content/7c23bcc5-0182-4767-ac4b-c39cd910d9ca</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https:/alexwilson.tech/content/7c23bcc5-0182-4767-ac4b-c39cd910d9ca</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 17:48:16 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickramsbottom.com/&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; helped me move my standing desk from Whitechapel, which was quite the adventure across London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... and this week I got a chair. A refurbished Herman Miller Mirra 2.  This is the first time I&apos;ve properly invested time &amp;#x26; money into getting a chair for the long-term and I&apos;m so glad I did: it&apos;s endlessly adjustable and actually &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-assembling a working space is a huge milestone - not only is home-working now again a serious (sustainable) option, I now also have a place where I can write and fiddle around with music production.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note to self: Write-up the disassembly/reassembly instructions for my desk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note to Nick: Please bring back your weeknotes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God I really missed having an audio setup that sounded good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the &lt;a href=&quot;https://technabob.com/blog/2011/11/29/little-printer-berg/&quot;&gt;Little Printer&lt;/a&gt;?  Several years late to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It prints stuff, from the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basically something of a dream machine. A way of instantly transforming, at relatively low cost, some information into something physical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily to-do lists, short summaries of the news, that kind of thing...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the device I have needed for years!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately it no longer exists, so I&apos;ve decided that building something like it is my next side-project.  This note is to create accountability!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since finishing Metroid Dread (100%!) I&apos;ve been playing Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. Another blast from the past, I played the original on GBA a &lt;em&gt;very long time ago&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as remakes go, it&apos;s quite true to form. Mechanics have been improved, the new 3D graphics are brilliant, but at its core it&apos;s still the same game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got to the end of the first in-game year and had accomplished everything it took me five in-game years to accomplish in the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming later this year, are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Pokemon-Shining-Pearl-1930567.html&quot;&gt;the Pokémon Diamond/Pearl remakes&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/Advance-Wars-1-2-Re-Boot-Camp-1987406.html&quot;&gt;remake of the first two Advance Wars games&lt;/a&gt;. I&apos;m all here for these nostalgia-inducing releases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I guess it&apos;s the Michaelmas/Autumn term now.  And I think I agreed to write a talk?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Dread — 10th October 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[After, 19 years since the previous game, Metroid Dread released this weekend and I'm not kidding when I say that this is a major milestone…]]></description><link>https:/alexwilson.tech/content/053a2634-113b-4223-98ed-443bd41a3061</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https:/alexwilson.tech/content/053a2634-113b-4223-98ed-443bd41a3061</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 22:47:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After, 19 years since the previous game, Metroid Dread released this weekend and I&apos;m not kidding when I say that this is a major milestone in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first experience with Metroid was playing Metroid: Zero Mission in the slightly awkward period between Primary and Secondary school, where you&apos;re saying goodbye to all of these people who are somewhere between acquaintances and friends, and hello to all of these new ones.  For me it was weird, I got a place in a selective school and lost some close friends over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coincidentally that is around about when I first started feeling imposter syndrome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really got into Gameboy Advance games in 2005, and after playing Pokémon a bunch, Metroid had this powerful sense of adventure.  There&apos;s an entire world, you&apos;re alone, and there&apos;s no (real) set path to finding your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reader, this was a perfect metaphor for a kid going through a difficult set of changes who didn&apos;t really have any &lt;em&gt;objective&lt;/em&gt; outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, I went through many of the other Metroid games.  Out-of-sequence, like the true Metroidvania experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metroid Fusion, I replay at least once a year, it&apos;s packed with story but unlike the other Metroid games - you don&apos;t really have to think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I arrived at Super Metroid.  It stuck with me.  The entire game — from its storytelling &amp;#x26; design, through to its dissection and optimisation in the speedrunning community — is a bit of a rallying point for technology.  &lt;em&gt;I &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1SJMwWUK3RY&quot;&gt;keep talking&lt;/a&gt; about it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my excitement when I started reading about Metroid: Dread, a game set for release imminently on the Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original announcement was 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;October, 2021: It has finally arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s 19 years since the last game, 16 since the announcement, and at least 15 that I&apos;ve been waiting.  Gosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a long weekend.  In Dread I&apos;ve reached 100% item collection (a first, for a first-playthrough) and have just beaten the game.  That&apos;s why this post is so late actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuinely reminds me of everything I loved, but with a few refreshing twists which feel actually fresh and not gimmicky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have opinions, but enough about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos, all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s been a few weeks since I last wrote one of these.  Just over a month, in fact.  There&apos;s a reason for that!  I&apos;ve finally restored a slightly nicer publishing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means I can now get back to my writing backlog, just in time for a few days off at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend my family surprised me in my new flat, for a visit.  We ordered Russian food and drank a bottle of &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldsbestwines.eu/grapes/kindzmarauli/&quot;&gt;Kindzmarauli&lt;/a&gt;.  This wasn&apos;t possible a year ago.  Wow, I needed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else have I been up to?  Well, making music mostly.  I&apos;m not happy or confident enough to publish any of it publicly, but thanks to James, Kara and Lucy for all of your feedback so far.  I really, really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rowanmanning.com/weeknotes/50/&quot;&gt;Rowan&lt;/a&gt; I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed our coffee too!  Unfortunately this doesn&apos;t come through as a webmention because I haven&apos;t over-engineered that bit of the publishing pipeline yet.  Congratulations, new home owner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I enjoyed hanging out with people who don&apos;t do webmentions too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah, enabling webmentions is probably a useful side-project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more people return to the City of London, and to our office in particular, I&apos;m starting to struggle with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My standups coincide with the optimal travel-into-work times, aka, when the Waterloo-and-City line isn&apos;t &lt;em&gt;rammed&lt;/em&gt;.  Yes, really, it&apos;s rammed again.  Queues and all.  What the heck October?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting a better working-from-home setup just jumped in priority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focusing while more and more people are (and more and more interesting things are happening) around you — is not easy.  Noise-cancelling doesn&apos;t cut out visual cues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, the FOMO of missing out on in-person human interaction is a powerful force&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess this is why people make and maintain friendships outside of school/work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, while grabbing dinner with a friend, a nearby Bloomberg PM was loudly complaining about something they were dealing with related to a project that I&apos;m working on.  Yikes was that awkward to overhear.  Reader, be careful if you&apos;ve gotta complain about work in public: you never know who might hear you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&apos;ve been thinking a lot about technical documentation this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Granted there are multiple classes of documentation - and I think they are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; important?  This week I&apos;ve been only reflecting on where to draw the line in applications logic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Self-documenting code&quot; usually &lt;em&gt;isn&apos;t&lt;/em&gt;.  By all means we should continue writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexkondov.com/one-line-of-code/&quot;&gt;delightful APIs&lt;/a&gt;, but... they aren&apos;t ever a replacement for also writing stuff down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes slightly simpler, less abstracted code (think, fewer layers) buys us time &amp;#x26; space to write things down: In plain language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With both approaches we have a looming maintenance problem: As both domain logic &amp;#x26; implementation evolve over time, so too must any abstractions &amp;#x26; written documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing to be suspended (and rarely resumed) in projects under increased pressure isn&apos;t tests.  It&apos;s documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abstractions tend to be adjusted in ways that quickly incur technical debt, but, perhaps the documentation debt is easier to pay back - and sooner?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since last year I&apos;ve been increasingly valuing a well-written PRD &amp;#x26; ERD over almost any other kind of project artefact. Something similar, closer to the code, more refined than types ... that feels like a good place to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well&quot;&gt;How To Edit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-edit/&quot;&gt;On Writing Well&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x26; &lt;a href=&quot;https://docsfordevelopers.com/&quot;&gt;Docs for Developers&lt;/a&gt; are now at the top of my technical reading list.  If you have any comments or suggestions, please send them my way!  There&apos;s a better write-up in here for sure (at least after I learn how to write).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the Great Apartment Furniture Fetch-Quest of &apos;21, on Saturday my friend Laura took me shopping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We trekked through most of central London — at least, from Kings Cross to &quot;Marble Arch Hill&quot; — trying to track down an Xbox Series X.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good lord I had no idea that skating was: A) so popular B) so expensive??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marble Arch Hill?  What a let-down.  It isn&apos;t even really that good of a view?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh yeah, and the London Transport Museum are still doing tours.  We tried (and failed) to walk into one.  Potentially the most exclusive activity in London right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end we sort-of gave up and went to the Microsoft &lt;del&gt;Store&lt;/del&gt; Experience Centre.  Microsoft weren&apos;t lying: it was an experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strangely reminiscent of an Apple Store.  But like, not.  Because it was an experience.  Honest!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now have an Xbox Series S: Bring on Perfect Dark!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week&apos;s chapter: &lt;em&gt;I don&apos;t know yet&lt;/em&gt;.  I made some other less exciting progress (most notably: getting a bed &amp;#x26; sofa and metric-tonne of cookware).  There&apos;s also some Wayfair stuff en-route.  Maybe I should just go to IKEA already?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ellen Allien, MARRØN &amp;#x26; Rebekah really know how to push a Funktion One set-up to its limits, as I have recently learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; the Teenage Engineering OB-4 really packs a punch too: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AlexWilsonV1/status/1431391545744310272&quot;&gt;One recently arrived, and, good god am I &lt;strong&gt;obsessed&lt;/strong&gt;??&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In related news I have resumed my obsession with Teenage Engineering equipment and modular synth.  This may be a bad thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did I miss something?  Music festivals are somehow back in full force.  This weekend I gawked at the line-ups of Reading Festival, Junction 2, Field Day &amp;#x26; Creamfields in extreme envy.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bicep&apos;s performance at Field Day got posted to Instagram a lot, and really stood out:  Sharp light-work + lasers &amp;#x26; really crisp synth-work.  Crikey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole pandemic thing really kind-of sucks.  It&apos;d be nice to have been able to go to &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these guilt-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Being double-booked didn&apos;t help.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, have you seen the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kathmanduandbeyond.com/ukrainian-institute-scientific-technological-research-development-kiev/&quot;&gt;Ukranian Institute of Scientific and Technological Research and Development&lt;/a&gt;? Gosh that building is wild. In a really good way. It&apos;s like a flying saucer landed on top of a bus station and this is honestly all of the commentary I am capable of providing because I don&apos;t really know what else to think.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Bestå de Blåhaj — 16th August 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[These can be only sort-of weekly, right?

&lt;h2&gt;Moving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week &amp;#x26; weekend I moved home. Sort-of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now live in Putney.  It&apos;s rather sunny here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately that also came with a commute.  Previously I had a 30 minute walk to work.  Now there are 2 trains taking roughly 45 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So, this post comes to you from an apartment with no furniture† and no internet‡.  So that&apos;s been fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Catching Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend I helped my friends Lucy &amp;#x26; Tanya move home. Or, rather, I assembled a single IKEA drawer before distracting them with dinner plans at CoCo Ichibanya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you know “Bestå” means “Consist”?  You do now.  Also “Blåhaj” means “Blue Shark” - you&apos;re welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The day before, my friends Gallal &amp;#x26; Ayo helped me move home. It took us about 15 minutes to load the comically oversized van and about 5 minutes to unload it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other highlights of the move include eating drive-thru McDs in Battersea Park next to the river, and ambling through Spitalfields for 15m trying to locate a car.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honestly though?  This &amp;#x26; last week have been pretty great in terms of exploiting the recent bout of good weather to catch-up with friends.  Some I hadn&apos;t seen since 2019?  That&apos;s &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this how people felt with long-distance friendships in the 1900s?  Send a letter (or, Signal/WhatsApp message) every few months, and occasionally brave the harsh seas (or, train) to see them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flavorwire.com/426492/10-great-letters-from-famous-authors&quot;&gt;Correspondance compilations are apparently a thing&lt;/a&gt; - if you were ever curious about what George Orwell talked about with his friends, you can actually find out.  (Spoiler: It&apos;s still kind-of weird.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Horace Lorimer&apos;s “Letters from a Self-Made Merchant to his Son” is entirely fictional but has definitely made me wonder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Just like in modern times, &quot;Self-made&quot; might be code for &quot;Made-up&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wonder how they&apos;d feel about &lt;a href=&quot;https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-by-default/&quot;&gt;Signal&apos;s push for &quot;ephemerality&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, aka, configuring an automatic disappearing messsage timer.  Real-world conversations don&apos;t get saved into a logfile forever, why should digital messages?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most importantly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ichibanya.uk/&quot;&gt;CoCo Ichibanya&lt;/a&gt; is fantastic.  Slowly working through recommending that everybody I know go there.  Chances are if you&apos;re reading this and you know me - you&apos;re on that list!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about technology?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh right yes, I forgot that I work in technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My personal technical debt keeps climbing and I just haven&apos;t had a chance to really fix it ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of that technical debt is to do with NodeJS dependencies starting to fall out of date: Some dependencies are doing hard updates to ES6 Modules.  Some consumers depend on very-wide-version-ranges, or worse, very old version ranges.  It leads to an interesting situation where by installing some security patches, some software is just left broken.  It either won&apos;t build, or more annoyingly, it has random runtime errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NodeJS - how I want to love you so - but you sure aren&apos;t designed for large, long-lived applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ah well, back to Rust I go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently designing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute/serverless&quot;&gt;Compute@Edge&lt;/a&gt; service in Rust which I am very excited about.  More to come on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s also like, a LOT? of outstanding blog posts for me to get to.  Guess I now know what to do while waiting for more furniture to arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, also, I&apos;ve started trying to compile a collection on neurodivergencies that either have helped me or have been recommended to me and I haven&apos;t got to yet.  If you have recommendations please send them through.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/90636253?shelf=nd&quot;&gt;The list is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reflection “Bestå” is a good subtitle for the last year, and for this previous week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;† A bedframe and sofa are both apparently arriving soon.
‡ 5G is a blessing.  A new router apparently arrives soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Mind The Gap — 31st July 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am writing weeknotes once more.

&lt;li&gt;I am writing weeknotes once more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gosh it&apos;s been a little while. There is much we must discuss, dear reader!  But all in good time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please mind the gap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Venturing Outside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This weekend I finally broke the cycle of not-doing-very-much courtesy of the pandemic and it&apos;s siblings anxiety &amp;#x26; social-isolation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went kayaking with some friends this weekend. And had a picnic. It was nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a boat go in a straight line &lt;em&gt;[against water, and wind]&lt;/em&gt; is rather difficult, it turns out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later met a friend for a drink. At a pub? (they still exist). Walked home. It was also nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We both got hit on by someone who was very, very under the influence of something. That was not so nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My body hurts from rowing, probably not helped by walking. This is a troubling sign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually, sorry, I lied, last weekend I celebrated a friend&apos;s birthday in Victoria park.  That was the first thing I did in meatspace recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing people, meeting new ones (post-RAT), is pretty surreal honestly. I&apos;m feeling a sense of enthused-trepidation about the whole thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe that when the highlight of your weekend is &quot;hanging tarpaulin between three trees just in case it rains&quot;
you are entitled to experiencing whichever life-crisis you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In definitely unrelated news, I am now experiencing a mid-20s crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aka &quot;the elephant in the room&quot;, or, &quot;Alex, why did you stop writing weeknotes, and why did you slow down writing more generally?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The short-answer: I did not have much to say for a little bit.  I broke the streak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Broken streaks are, as I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve learned from your past few failed attempts to learn German on Duolingo (&lt;em&gt;c&apos;mon let&apos;s be honest reader?&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/why-breaking-a-streak-feels-so-awful.html&quot;&gt;ironically very self-defeating&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our streaks play at loss-aversion. Why break that number which is reaching its high hundreds?
But ... What happens when we inevitably miss a day, and lose that number?  Will that number ever climb back up?  &lt;em&gt;Is there even any point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honestly I&apos;m petrified of breaking my Apple-Health Activity streak.  Or my Kindle streak.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real lesson here, is that keeping up a streak is a very weak form of motivation.  I&apos;m going to work on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minding The Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Okay, so this phrase is on my mind because I have been thinking about the London Underground a lot recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might just be me? But I used to legitimately dislike the sort-of outside stations like Faringdon.  Now I really enjoy them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of Kings Cross station being entirely underground seems quite unpleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That said why do we listen to grumpy Brits talking about gaps?  I miss the tunes that play on the JR. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTD6_k-9bkU&quot;&gt;Seseragi brings back memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically I wanted to reflect on the use-case of graphQL when migrating or adapting application architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;re building a new thing and are extracting functionality piece-by-piece from your older system or systems, chances are your architecture looks like (or will look like) something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/20200119--simple.png&quot; alt=&quot;simple&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great!  That&apos;s nice and elegant: The old system continues to support capabilities which the new system cannot yet deliver, buying valuable time to make sure that the functionality delivered is of high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit high-level though, and especially as modern architecture has a strong bias for microservices it won&apos;t hurt to look at the details.  Thinking about the requirements of such a system ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/20200119--new-but-super-messy.png&quot; alt=&quot;new-but-super-messy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our problem is clear: There&apos;s a heavy number of dependencies on specific implementation details of the legacy systems, which will make migrating away considerably harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we improve the situation, and make it easier to replace the legacy systems when we&apos;re ready?
Immediately we can clean things up by introducing some form of abstraction layer, ideally we should be scoping several pint-sized services to replace individual capabilities. However this can be cumbersome to design and troublesome to maintain, which is where GraphQL comes into its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is the subject of a lot of buzz which can make it hard to select it on objective terms, however there are a few elements of its design which make it incredibly good at addressing the extract project use-case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphQL can perform queries across multiple backend systems, and can resolve and join this data together. This is especially handy when bridging multiple data sources (e.g. a monolith depending on many external APIs, or an ancient Service-Oriented-Architecture which has complex dependencies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphQL data is defined as your view model, meaning that important and common data transformations are performed once centrally which improves the consistency of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphQL consumers specify both which data they require, and how it will be returned to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GraphQL consumers are able to type their data and so can implement rich error handling &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; needing to understand every detail of the legacy systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some drawbacks to implementing GraphQL in this way: It requires a good understanding of the business domain when initially modelling as it&apos;s frustrating to make major changes to the schema. In addition, it is a single point of failure to potentially more redundant systems — but all this aside, &lt;strong&gt;it is a fantastic starting point because all of these problems can be solved later&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/20200119--new-but-less-messy.png&quot; alt=&quot;new-but-less-messy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a model which we implemented last year in FT Specialist to beginning a lengthy migration away from an estate of legacy monoliths which allowed us to innovate elsewhere in our technology stack. If you&apos;re interested in solving these sorts of problems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://roles.ft.com/&quot;&gt;the FT is hiring in both London and Sofia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Deploying static sites with Github Actions]]></title><description><![CDATA[First, some background: Github Pages is a brilliant way to build static websites quickly and easily.

&lt;p&gt;Github Pages is a brilliant way to build static websites quickly and easily. However it is quite
limited as it only runs Jekyll, which is in safe mode — meaning only template customisations were
possible.  Last year after growing frustrated with hacking together template-driven functionality
like RSS feeds and article recommendations, I replatformed to Gatsby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Porting was relatively straightforward and has brought a swathe of benefits including pluggable APIs
and the ability to write unit tests, but it also introduced a new problem: I didn&apos;t have a way of
deploying the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring my options, pairing Github Actions (to build) with Github Pages (to host) seemed rather
attractive as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions have tight integration with Github allowing me to keep my workflows in one place. Other
CI/CD offerings added extra overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actions seemed customisable enough to implement Github Pages again with minimal overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If anything happens to Actions or Pages, both are simple enough that migrating to something else
is realistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These all proved to be true, and I was able to quickly put together something quite usable.
A few months of small tweaks and one refactor later, I am happy enough to talk about what I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building a workflow in Github Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github Actions is still relatively new so there&apos;s not a lot of documentation out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to start with writing a Github Actions script, there are three things we need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it is called, with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to run this action, with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;on&lt;/code&gt; key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What it will do, with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/code&gt; key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the simplest, the name, I called my workflow &quot;Build, Test and Deploy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Test and Deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I wanted this to run for all branches.  An important note is that &lt;strong&gt;Github Actions will not
trigger for pushes that it performs&lt;/strong&gt;, so while I have excluded the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch here, this
was more for readability than to prevent unexpected behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;!gh-pages&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;*&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we can start defining some jobs. Each has a unique ID which is also its key in the jobs block,
and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; key which is used the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept this simple, and required each step to wait for the previous one to succeed with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/code&gt; key.
We can choose a task-runner using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/code&gt; key, I opted for &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;ubuntu-latest&lt;/code&gt; for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Test
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; build
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Deploy
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this all together, we now have a skeleton workflow which we can customise to our needs. Here
I&apos;ve also added a checkout step to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; Test and Deploy
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;branches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;!gh-pages&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;*&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;jobs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Checkout Code
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@master
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Test
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; build
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Deploy
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing specifically on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; job, we can now add a few steps to perform the
build process, so that we can later on test it and deploy it.
Our input is our source-code and our output is a build artifact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve commented inline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Firstly, let&apos;s check-out our code.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Checkout Code
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@master

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Now let&apos;s configure this environment to support NodeJS tooling.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/setup&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;node@master

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Now run an npm install...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Install Dependencies
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm install

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Run the build-script, which is a package.json script in this case.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Build
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm run build
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean important&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# This is done to prevent output being too verbose.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Use Github&apos;s upload-artifact action to upload our hopefully-successful build!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# We only want the `public` folder here which contains our (optimised) static site.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Save Build Artifact
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/upload&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;artifact@v1
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; site&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;artifact &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# A unique key (and name) for the artifact in question.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; public        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# This is what we&apos;d like to keep, we want `public` but any file/folder works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome! Now we have a workflow which builds and saves an artifact, which is actually downloadable
from the Github UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the site is being built, let&apos;s add a few steps to the test workflow to run some tests.
Our input is our source code, our build artifact. We don&apos;t return anything, but we do throw an error
if any tests fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Test
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; build
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Again, we check-out our code.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# This is needed as we will be executing tests which are outside of the artifact.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Checkout
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@master

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Next up, we download the pre-built artifact.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Download Website Artifact
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/download&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;artifact@v1
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; site&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;artifact &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# We reference the original artifact name.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; public        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# and instruct that the artifact is restored to the `public` folder.&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Configure node and reinstall dependencies (each task has a unique workspace!)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/setup&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;node@master
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Install Dependencies
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm install

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Finally run our tests. The output can be tweaked so Github Actions better understands it.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Run Tests
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can absolutely be done inside the build step to save time — I kept them separate to enable
adding end-to-end tests and a few other tools which are irrelevant to the actual build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&apos;ve built and tested an artifact, we&apos;re finally ready to deploy it. This time things are
a little bit trickier, and we&apos;re going to break out into a custom action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Deploy to Github Pages environment&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;deploy-production&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Deploy to Production
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;needs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; test
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;runs-on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ubuntu&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;latest

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# I&apos;ve added this extra step, so that this task *only* runs on the master branch.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# This syntax is quite expressive and allows for much richer conditions.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; github.ref == &apos;refs/heads/master&apos;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Again we check-out.  This time as we&apos;ll be referencing a custom action!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Checkout
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@master

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# And again, we download the website artifact. This time so we can deploy it!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Download Website Artifact
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/download&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;artifact@v1
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; site&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;artifact
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; public

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# A custom action!  I&apos;ll explain a bit more about this below.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Deploy to Github Pages
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ./.github/actions/github&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;pages/
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now let&apos;s look at how we can push to the Github Pages branch of this current repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This operation takes place primarily in Git, and luckily we have enough information available to us
to be able to find and push to Github&apos;s HTTP Git endpoint. As we&apos;re deploying an artifact each time
we don&apos;t have access to the existing Git history, so let&apos;s go ahead and create a new repository and
push it every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; -e

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Here we take an argument to choose which folder we release.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$*&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Deploying &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${GITHUB_SHA}&lt;/span&gt; to GitHub Pages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;REPOSITORY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;https://x-access-token:&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${GITHUB_TOKEN}&lt;/span&gt;@github.com/&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}&lt;/span&gt;.git&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Create a new repository and reference this one, with an HTTP token.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; init
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; remote &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; origin &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$REPOSITORY&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Checkout the gh-pages branch, and reset to the latest version.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout -b gh-pages

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Configure Git to perform the commit as the user who triggered this action.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## If the build wasn&apos;t triggered by a human this will be the person who last committed to the branch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; config user.name &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${GITHUB_ACTOR}&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; config user.email &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${GITHUB_ACTOR}&lt;/span&gt;@users.noreply.github.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## Finally, add the contents of our script&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; commit -m &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Deploying &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;${GITHUB_SHA}&lt;/span&gt; to Github Pages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## And force push to the gh-pages branch so Github Pages can serve it!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push --force origin gh-pages:gh-pages
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; -fr .git
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token variable&quot;&gt;$GITHUB_WORKSPACE&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Successfully deployed.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, to be able to use this custom shell script we wrap it in a basic Dockerfile including Git
and minimal boilerplate to make it usable as a custom action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-dockerfile&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# We use the alpine git image as it&apos;s the smallest for what we need.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; alpine/git:latest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Github actions use a few Docker labels for interacting with custom actions.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;maintainer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Alex Wilson &amp;lt;alex@alexwilson.tech&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;com.github.actions.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;GitHub Pages Deploy&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;com.github.actions.description&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;Deploy to GitHub Pages.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;com.github.actions.icon&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;upload-cloud&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;com.github.actions.color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;blue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# The most important bit other than the parent image is this: We add the below script&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# to actually do the Github Pages deploy step and make it the entrypoint.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt; entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token instruction&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;ENTRYPOINT&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;/entrypoint.sh&quot;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deploying - Letting Github Pages know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, unfortunately that wasn&apos;t enough.  Even though we&apos;ve pushed to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch, Github
won&apos;t do anything because we &lt;em&gt;pushed&lt;/em&gt; this using Github Actions.  Remember that I said that Actions
won&apos;t trigger itself to prevent a circular dependency?  Well this is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; protection in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, we can mitigate this by using the Github Pages API.  We use it to queue another Pages
build as our final deployment step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Trigger a Pages Update
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token scalar string&quot;&gt;
        curl -sS -X POST -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}&quot; \
        https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/pages/builds \&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a new prerequisite - we now need to add the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;GITHUB_PAGES_DEPLOY_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; environment variable,
with a new Personal Access Token which has Repository scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Optimising the whole thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that we&apos;re repeatedly reinstalling dependencies which is a little bit wasteful.
Thankfully, as well as artifact support, Github Actions also offer us a caching mechanism which we can
to speed this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to mention that Github only keeps the cache alive for a maximum of 7 days since the last
build, but if you build at least a week this won&apos;t be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/setup&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;node@master

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# Store NPM&apos;s global cache, using the package-lock.json our cache key.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Restore NPM Cache
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/cache@v1
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; cache&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;npm
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; ~/.npm
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; npm&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; hashFiles(&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;**/package-lock.json&apos;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# And the same for node_modules, using the package-lock.json our cache key.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Restore node_modules
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/cache@v1
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; cache&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;node_modules
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; node_modules
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; node_modules&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; hashFiles(&apos;&lt;span class=&quot;token important&quot;&gt;**/package-lock.json&apos;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re also able to tweak the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;checkout&lt;/code&gt; step to speed it up a bit, by adding the shallow clone directive.
After-all, we are not interacting with the project history here — we&apos;re only building it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-yaml&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Checkout
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;uses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; actions/checkout@master
      &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;fetch-depth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adding history and rollbacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice benefit of using this workflow on Github Pages is that we&apos;re also creating an artifact ins Git
itself which makes rolling back a standard git operation, something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;command-line-prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; fetch origin
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout -t origin/gh-pages
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; reset &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;commit-id&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; push gh-pages --force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem: We currently overwrite our history so we can&apos;t revert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and remedy this I made a small adjustment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;## We still checkout the gh-pages branch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; checkout -b gh-pages

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# But this time, we fetch the existing one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; fetch origin gh-pages

&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;# And soft reset to its latest commit to avoid any conflicts.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; reset --soft origin/gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workflow has been fantastic for me and I&apos;ve been able to focus on making site adjustments
without constantly having to repair a build process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexwilson/personal-website/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-test-deploy.yml&quot;&gt;You can see the entire, finished workflow here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexwilson/personal-website/tree/master/.github/actions/github-pages&quot;&gt;the custom action here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as Actions I have now added a few bots, a scheduled build (to detect problems) and Slack
notifications, all of which let me keep up-to-date with the fast-moving world of node dependencies
without incurring side-project fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up I&apos;ll be looking at creative ways of improving the writing workflow (spellcheck and editor
experience).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Explainer: Immutable Infrastructure]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the years we have introduced ever-more creative ways to run our software.

Hand-crafted servers became configuration managed. Then VMs rolled along. The VMs became auto-scalable, and in time, started running scores of containers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most modern software being deployed to the web is likely to run in a container of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got here by continually optimising to balance ever-growing complexity in our technology against problems emerging when us pesky humans try to use, operate and adapt our technology.
By using code to describe as much as we can about how we expect our applications to run, we’re able to make some of the same assumptions we do about our software
i.e. &lt;em&gt;Under known conditions our product will meet its requirements&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is readable and repeatable by a computer, we are able to prove this assumption using software testing methodologies. This is referred to as Infrastructure as Code&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref-2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand mutability as a property of systems, it&apos;s easier to first understand what &lt;strong&gt;Mutable Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; is.  Mutable infrastructure may be changed (&lt;em&gt;mutated&lt;/em&gt;), and many of our personal computers are like this.  When installing software or changing some settings, our computer is updated in-place and we don&apos;t notice a difference.  This is how a lot of IT has traditionally been run, where every change takes effect immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary disadvantage of this approach is that it requires us to know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what to change and over time, our confidence that this will be successful naturally decreases.  When releasing 10+ versions of a piece of software in a week (or, for example, applying security patches) the system drifts further and further away from where it was when we first created it, which is the last time we were mostly sure about what it looked like.  When dealing with many systems (e.g. I am serving 100+ customers per hour and need a few computers to handle the load) this becomes incredibly hard to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; unchanging: Resources (e.g. Containers) may not be changed, and so whenever a change needs to be made — no matter how big or small — they are completely replaced instead of being modified or updated. This can be incredibly complex to manage as it may require running multiple versions of an application at the same time which has implications on data integrity.
The end-result is that every release will leave the system, or systems, in exactly the expected (and tested) state which theoretically reduces the amount of unknowns. It makes it easier to manage many systems, as whenever something goes wrong, we can either roll-back or replace individual systems with new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll talk about some of the disadvantages of this approach in a separate post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn-1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containers&lt;/strong&gt; are a basic unit of cloud-computing. A container is a portion of a virtual computer and many can be deployed onto one computer at a time. Companies like Amazon and Google sell the capability to run many containers at a time so that you don&apos;t have to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; is a popular containerising tool.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref-1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn-2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/strong&gt; (IaC) describes our ability to specify our desired resources and their state in code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ansible.com&quot;&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; are frequently used to achieve this.&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref-2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

keen to take the opportunity to get as much unbiased, objective feedback as I could while winding down and offboarding
from &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluetel.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Bluetel&lt;/a&gt;.  As well as speaking to some people — including former-colleagues — about their
experiences with me over the years, I wanted something more regimented that I could compare against in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/johari-window.html&quot;&gt;Anna Shipman&apos;s excellent post&lt;/a&gt; on using a Johari
window to understand her strengths, I decided to try doing the same thing.  Against her advice, I decided to use a
Google form because I wanted to &quot;own&quot; my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reflection it&apos;s entirely possible that this has biased my results, as it presents the options in a very linear
format!  Nonetheless I found a &lt;a href=&quot;https://kevan.org/johari&quot;&gt;very nice tool by Kevan&lt;/a&gt; which I recommend for future
exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What was my process?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent out the survey via Slack to 8 random colleagues — whom I&apos;d worked with at some point over my 5½ years — hoping
to try and get as fair an assessment as possible.  I&apos;m quite confident that this was the best way of going about it, as
only asking named individuals within a single team or two would have likely given feedback biased on factors unrelated
to my personality (such as perceived performance, which tends to be rather similar within a given team).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of that 8, I received 5 (mostly) anonymous responses.  Then (without peeking!) I selected the six adjectives which I
felt best fit my personality from my own perspective, and after mapping, ended up with the following window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results and takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/20190414--johari-window.png&quot; alt=&quot;Johari window results&quot; title=&quot;Johari widow results&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one-hand, these results are remarkably good! There&apos;s a trend towards more stoic personality traits which
reflect my core values and I hope have made a net-positive impression on people I&apos;ve worked with.
&lt;em&gt;For now at least, this works wonders for my imposter syndrome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, two other values I felt like I had carefully internalised — Empathy and Helpfulness — did not come
up at all. It&apos;s possible that some of the ambiguity in the traits which &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; identified alluded to the same thing,
however instead of dwelling on possibilities, I think that this simply marks an opportunity to better direct future
requests for feedback from the people I work with.  Then comparing future results against these in a few years time
perhaps I will come across a bit better.  Or perhaps I will have changed tact completely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the Johari window process has been hugely motivating and has shown me where and how I can continue to develop.
It&apos;s remarkable how much power a feedback process which &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; excludes negativity can have, for personal growth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad to have gone through this exercise and strongly recommend you, dear reader, do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The FT is moving back to Bracken House soon. Most of my group had our inductions this week. It&apos;s very, very nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During our induction an audio engineer was tuning the event space&apos;s sound system with &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/4waVSC9eSkrt6RxJK3DhwW?si=JKspSCaaQDWApKTrc1tctA&quot;&gt;Four Tet&apos;s Only Human&lt;/a&gt;:
Bring on the journalist raves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There aren&apos;t any coffee machines. 🙃&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photo behind this blog post is of the gorgeous sundial decorating the original entrance to the building,
featuring a mug-shot of Winston Churchill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... just in time really, because it turns out that the current building, One Southwark Bridge, has an infestation of
mice. This week I&apos;ve seen them attempting to conquer the land beneath my boss&apos;s desk.
&lt;em&gt;It&apos;s the weekend now so they&apos;ve probably won.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Micro-frontends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week I&apos;ve been thinking about the concept of micro-frontends, after reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/understanding-micro-frontends-b1c11585a297&quot;&gt;an incredibly good article&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/onrzfr&quot;&gt;Öner Zafer&lt;/a&gt; explaining what they are, why they&apos;re useful and how to go about
building them.  I love the theory and it&apos;s something that the FT does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s difficult to maintain isolation and to keep boilerplate to a minimum. For changes spanning multiple apps, these
now require a lot of management and tooling (either to bring the apps into one place, i.e. a monorepo, or to repeat
the changes across many repositories) which can be tiresome for a team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, it&apos;s if isolation is successful, it can be really hard to share code.  The latest way my team tackled the
problem has been to subtree-split at CI and publish components to Github/NPM.  This is limiting and still requires
manual intervention to &quot;bump&quot; the dependencies on a per-application basis!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s also hard to draw boundaries (but maybe this is a team-organisation thing?) between applications, for instance
the difference between the app-shell, a utility component used by two-or-more services (but not all) and components
used by individual apps only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A particular library/solution introduced by Öner, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mosaic9.org&quot;&gt;Project Mosiac&lt;/a&gt;, looks like it offers
some good answers to these problems by taking away ownership of the app-shell from a given application, delegating
those to a layout service, called Tailor — which is orchestrated by the Routing tier — and by enforcing standards
to shared code (in the form of the shared component/utility library, Shaker). I&apos;m keen to explore this approach
next to see if it solves the problems I&apos;ve outlined above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;QA is not Quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last weekend I put up the video for my talk, QA is not Quality:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/talks/2019-03-19-qa-is-not-quality-brumjs/&quot;&gt;You can watch it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually gave this thing in March, this was my first public speaking experience in quite some time and overall I&apos;m
glad that I did it. I started off nervous, got into stride, and then lost it a little bit later in. People overall
have been incredibly nice and positive about it and apparently there was some demand for the VOD/slides, so I think
I&apos;d like to do it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now I&apos;m thinking about how to try and write this thing up, and I think really it makes sense to break it down (as I
did within the talk itself) by category into a series and to write-up a mini-guide for each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keen for feedback on the talk and its content, if you have any please get in touch!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next up, I&apos;m speaking at BrumPHP in April about CDNs!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes&quot;&gt;Alice&apos;s weaknotes series is really nice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between jobs I made a Johari window which was an incredibly rewarding, and uniquely insightful experience. You can
&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/blog/2019/04/14/taking-a-look-through-a-johari-window/&quot;&gt;read about it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The secret to becoming an influencer on LinkedIn?  &lt;a href=&quot;https://ovaledge.com/data-analytics-oleg/&quot;&gt;Be incredibly positive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The human race made an incredibly big breakthrough this week, in the form of the Black-Hole Initiative generating an
image of a black-hole. &lt;em&gt;Go humanity!&lt;/em&gt; Like with all good news, this has somehow generated controversy. Which I had
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antoligy/status/1117076648933888002&quot;&gt;some opinions on&lt;/a&gt;. If you contributed to this project in
any way, shape or form, &lt;em&gt;thank-you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I subscribed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/&quot;&gt;HBR&lt;/a&gt; and you should too! They have incredibly good content on equality and
building a strategy (primarily for business, but really for just about anything). I also really like the format and
structure of their &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2018/01/podcast-dear-hbr&quot;&gt;Dear HBR&lt;/a&gt; podcast which delves into topics like
mixed feedback in the workplace and dealing with complex emotions.&lt;/li&gt;

At the beginning of the month I was away adventuring in Hong Kong, and as I write this, I am in London about to begin a new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday the 29th marked the final chapter of my time at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bluetel.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Bluetel&lt;/a&gt; (“Alexit”) and on Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/antoligy/status/1098993524459089921&quot;&gt;I start a new chapter at the Financial Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot happened this month and I think that at least some of it is worth writing about so I have populated my newly-minted “Writing” Trello board with a few ideas. &lt;em&gt;At least, that’s my excuse for not cleaning-up/publishing any notes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&apos;t planning on saying anything else in this post, but: In just a few days, Google are sunsetting Google Inbox, which is a huge shame. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antoligy/status/1112458207358869515&quot;&gt;I guess they weren’t really trying to hide that it had dropped in priority though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes — 16th February 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[It’s been a busy few weeks.

But I think, overall, worthwhile. I will have some exciting news to share next week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two weeks ago I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2019/&quot;&gt;FOSDEM 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which is run in Brussels. It was my first time in Belgium and even after struggling with a confusing subway system, I loved it. The conference itself was incredibly cool, and I actually began writing up some of the highlights in that week’s weeknotes but have given up as there was just too much going on.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BtcHVEHlfVG/&quot;&gt;The photo is of the Palace of Justice, which has its own fun background.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent the first half of this week learning about Nikkei’s approach to handling data warehousing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/HajimeSano1/jaws-ug-bigdata-branch-oct-2017&quot;&gt;the specifics&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/HajimeSano1/amazon-redshift-in-action&quot;&gt;very impressive&lt;/a&gt;.  There is an open-source web client-side tracking library that goes alongside it, and it’s particularly interesting because it implements a number of web performance tricks—including listening to requestAnimationFrame, queuing events to fire via beacon and using intersection observers to monitor page tracking—to minimise overhead to the user. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Nikkei/atlas-tracking-js&quot;&gt;Its source is available here and is well worth a read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the past few years podcasts have been becoming a larger and larger part of my life, and if &lt;a href=&quot;https://musicoomph.com/podcast-statistics/&quot;&gt;various industry stats&lt;/a&gt;  have anything to say about it, I’m not alone.  They’re a very disruptive media form which nobody has really figured out.  This week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macstories.net/news/spotify-acquires-podcast-producer-gimlet-media-and-app-maker-anchor/&quot;&gt;Spotify rather abruptly bought Gimlet media&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest independent podcast networks out there, claiming to want to preserve its independence (both in general, and from Spotify’s distribution platform).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall it’s an interesting MO, and Spotify seem to want to build out a regularly updated, spoken-word repertoire: Where music streaming is becoming increasingly competitive—and with music licensing increasingly combative—podcasting has been rather quiet, dominated by Apple and niche “power-user” services like Overcast and Pocket Casts. Since introducing their podcasting platform last year, Spotify has surged ahead and have become the &lt;a href=&quot;https://podnews.net/update/spotify-number-2&quot;&gt;second largest podcast platform&lt;/a&gt;, rather incredibly by &lt;em&gt;adding to&lt;/em&gt; (and not taking from) market-share. So are podcasts the key to Spotify’s salvation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/&quot;&gt;AWS released a new iconset.&lt;/a&gt; I appreciate this probably doesn’t mean much to anyone, but I really didn’t like the old one. So, yay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Thursday I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/AWS-User-Group-West-Midlands/%5D&quot;&gt;Birmingham AWS Meetup&lt;/a&gt; and learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sysdig.com&quot;&gt;Sysdig&lt;/a&gt;, an incredibly cool debugging tool.  It reminds me a lot of the utility of eBPF, but has built-in eventing and so can be used to automate a stack. Their value proposition of “rich monitoring and eventing” is that it can be used as a user-land-level security tool in a container platform, and for example can be used to whitelist the system calls a given container can actually execute. And then adjust if you have misconfigured. Very cool stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is by no means new, but I only found out about it this week.  Los-Angeles Metro commissioned some videos which I can only describe as  … I am not even really sure, but please give it a watch. It is glorious. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdesfldDAhY&quot;&gt;Metro Manners PSA: Super Kind – No loud music ミュジック - YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Open University is offering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.open.edu/openlearn/free-courses/full-catalogue&quot;&gt;some courses for free&lt;/a&gt;. And the selection is actually pretty OK!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;From resizing images to infrastructure problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After migrating the original version of the application to Kubernetes last year, this week (specifically, Sunday) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/imagecdn/imagecdn/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md&quot;&gt;I updated ImageCDN to v2&lt;/a&gt;, a rewrite in Node. I placed a strong emphasis on trying to improve its concurrency as I found that the greatest limitation with PHP and PHP-PM was that it was very easy to overload the service and bring it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Along the way of rewriting the ImageCDN core I had a lot of fun learning about &lt;a href=&quot;https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips/&quot;&gt;libvips&lt;/a&gt;, which is a superb if somewhat underrated image processing library. With more-or-less the same file-size output as ImageMagick, libvips is able to produce better, more-accurate images with significantly less memory usage. Hopefully I will be able to use it in future projects. Expect a write-up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the move back from Kubernetes?  It’s a really nice technology but it isn’t deploy-and-forget when dealing with non-trivial workloads despite the hype. Cluster maintenance is required as time goes on, and to be effective it is essential to allocate a healthy portion of the cluster resources to monitoring and observability activities. Which adds up pretty quickly. For a free service this meant a lot of operational overhead and a pretty costly cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Di-slack-tions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My experiment with Slack &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antoligy/status/1088183564770992135&quot;&gt;has had an interesting result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At first I got a lot of comments from people mildly irritated that I was no longer immediately reachable, but overall it has been ok. Seeing this success I started rolling this change out to my other messaging apps, and started using email a little bit more for managing notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now I have noticed an interesting behaviour pattern: When I&apos;ve sent a message or I am expecting a reply from someone (say I am in a Slack conversation), I actively go into a &quot;polling loop&quot;, cycling between the task I am working on and the messaging platform I am expecting a reply on. It&apos;s certainly better than before, but is definitely still rather draining.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m doing a talk! At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-MzfqIqCy/events/fppxlqyzfbzb/&quot;&gt;BrumJS on the 19th of March&lt;/a&gt;. My topic is is software quality, how it is largely misunderstood, how only a small portion can be handled by “QA”, and then how to measure and improve it. I will be writing it up after-the-fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo seem to have restarted development on Metroid Prime 4, which sounds bad. Actually it&apos;s great news: Now Retro Studios are taking the reigns. My nostalgia bias is incredibly happy that Retro is picking this up, by my nostalgic inner-child is upset that this means the release date has been pushed back indefinitely. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Dread&quot;&gt;Dread&lt;/a&gt; to think how long we might have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve started planning a holiday to visit Hong Kong: Asia is incredibly exciting region and I’m quite thrilled to explore a new city!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booking flights led me into the rabbit-hole of British Airways’ outfit of Airbus A380s and all of the quirks. Most amusing is Seat 25D: It is a standard, economy-class seat with all of the usual amenities of British Airways Economy. However, row 24 skips seat D to allow an escape-hatch for the crew’s cabin underneath, meaning that 25D includes double the normal leg-room. On its own, this isn’t too exciting, but BA took this in stride and reserved all of these seats for their Silver-tier members and up, charging a little extra for the seat with the promise of free champagne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: ReInvent — 8th December 2018]]></title><description><![CDATA[Monday night I flew back to the UK.

The difference between the efficiency and cleanliness of Haneda airport and Heathrow is already very stark, but it has nothing on English trains: I walked into 40m of service disruptions on the London Underground! Groan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We shot a short 30 second bumper video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r0wBPYDHJ8&quot;&gt;recapping NAR product development work in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Reflecting on it&apos;s been an interesting year, full of lots of interesting challenges and I&apos;m really proud of everything we have accomplished and achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Tackling Di-Slack-tions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ongoing effort to try and improve my focus and presence I have experimentally set Slack to keep me in do-not-disturb.  My hypothesis is that the majority of Slack notifications I currently receive are not time sensitive, and that giving users the ability to choose when they want my attention (via the Do-Not-Disturb override) will make me more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took this particular action after receiving some feedback that in many meetings it looks like I’m not paying full attention: This isn’t wholly inaccurate.  I actively filter out distractions as much as possible, such as emails and instant messages, however, give Slack a wide berth as it’s normally relevant: But this is a rabbit-hole and sometimes it’s easy to stop paying attention in favour of responding to unimportant Slack messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over time I have also been acutely aware that sometimes I may receive a notification, open Slack to clear the notification and then passively read the message—later forgetting that one has been sent, resulting in missing important [but less time sensitive] messages!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To measure success, I’m planning on measuring the volume of Slack messages I send as well as asking people informally if they feel like this has helped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since Slack enforce a limit that you can’t be in do-not-disturb for longer than a year I have also put together a small Lambda function to periodically cycle through all of my workspaces every week and keep extending my do-not-disturb.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AWS reInvent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS reInvent took place last week, and they released &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of stuff. Too much stuff to really go over, so after catching up with the event, here are a few of my favourites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/&quot;&gt;Amazon Timestream&lt;/a&gt; — Two weeks ago I was looking for an AWS-hostable time series DB. Amazon now have one. Where did you put the cameras, Amazon??&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/&quot;&gt;AWS LakeFormation&lt;/a&gt; — Describe and form an entire AWS-based data lake easily: Raw data is preprocessed, classified and stored at rest in S3 so that it can be easily used and queried by other tools. This is interesting because it allows you to focus on building a very performant data pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-amazon-managed-streaming-for-kafka-in-public-preview/&quot;&gt;Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka&lt;/a&gt; — The specifics here will be very interesting, it&apos;s a bold move for Amazon to bring this as it makes the differentiation between Kafka and Kinesis a little trickier. So I suppose Kinesis is better here for AWS-native streaming and reacting to events using something like Lambda, whereas Kafka makes use-cases where having the stream also be a datastore (say, you&apos;re doing event-sourcing). Pricing also looks to be quite competitive with Aiven and Heroku.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-amazon-qldb/&quot;&gt;Amazon Quantum Ledger Database&lt;/a&gt;—Yes, yes, Amazon also announced a blockchain-like product but actually that&apos;s not that important to me: For me one of the most interesting features of the Blockchain is the concept of an immutable ledger (ignoring some blockchain problems such as forks), and Amazon are now offering a database product which is, just that: An immutable ledger. But with no operational or scaling problems to solve and much more productive developer tooling (building UIs based on Ethereum is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fun!): It&apos;s a real database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/textract/&quot;&gt;Amazon Textract&lt;/a&gt; — So as someone with a massive amount of data between Dropbox, Evernote and a couple of scanners/cameras, I&apos;d really like to start extracting my content in order to go fully paperless. I haven&apos;t tried this yet, and I&apos;m sure there was another service in AWS doing this previously, so very keen to give this a go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/controltower/&quot;&gt;AWS Control Tower&lt;/a&gt; — AWS organisation-wide governance tooling! I can only imagine how large some of the larger organisations using AWS are starting to become, and so tooling like this is going to be very well received indeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/&quot;&gt;AWS Security Hub&lt;/a&gt; —&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/&quot;&gt;AWS Outposts&lt;/a&gt; — For anyone doing on-prem this is going to open up many doors! The short-version is that this allows running physical centres using AWS cloud governance tooling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-aws-app-mesh---service-mesh-for-microservices-on-aws/&quot;&gt;AWS App Mesh&lt;/a&gt; — The press-release suggests that this is mostly hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.envoyproxy.io&quot;&gt;Envoy&lt;/a&gt;. Good to see Amazon running more popular CNCF software, and integrating with the wider Kubernetes stack. At this rate, Prometheus in 2019? 😄&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-aws-cloud-map/&quot;&gt;AWS Cloud Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API Gateway WebSockets — Awesome! Can we have EventSources next please? :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/s3-intelligent-tiering/&quot;&gt;S3 INT&lt;/a&gt; — S3 Intelligent Tiering. You turn this on, and it reduces the availability of less frequently accessed objects (of course they are still accessible).  Very keen to see how this performs in production: A common pattern for me is to keep hundreds of thousands of images in an S3 bucket, however, given the behaviour patterns of news websites, normally an image is only frequently accessed for the first couple of weeks after an article has been published and so Intelligent Tiering will still allow old images to be accessed but at a great cost-saving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/s3-batch-operations/&quot;&gt;S3 Batch Operations&lt;/a&gt; — This is one which has hit me a couple of times. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/blog/2017/11/30/updating-permissions-in-large-s3-buckets/&quot;&gt;In-fact, enough that I wrote about it&lt;/a&gt;.  Managing metadata en-masse in S3 is an absolute nightmare, although it seems that now there is going to be functionality to do this properly, although going by the press-release this might be a UI-only thing in which case I&apos;d still have a problem. &lt;em&gt;(BTW it took me 3 hours in Golang, not 3 months!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://firecracker-microvm.github.io&quot;&gt;Firecracker&lt;/a&gt; — Amazon have open-sourced their new container run-time in-use for AWS Lambda and other areas of their service.  This is not the only such effort going on right now, Fastly and Cloudflare (amongst many others) are doing this sort of work in improving runtimes to help solve the new scaling and performance problems of today, which are starting to crop up as function-as-a-service architecture grows in popularity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/alb-can-now-invoke-lambda-functions-to-serve-https-requests/&quot;&gt;Lambda via ALB&lt;/a&gt; — This is a very big deal, and I am surprised I haven&apos;t heard more noise about it! Lambda@Edge is too slow and limited to really recognise the benefits of edge computing in the AWS cloud, but, now, making full applications directly routable via application load balancers means that it is possible to build your &lt;em&gt;entire presentation tier&lt;/em&gt; directly with Lambda. Now that is seriously cool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also particularly interested in some of the developments around AppSync: GraphQL is my preferred strategy of choice for interacting with tricky (read: legacy, chattery or clunky) system APIs. Starting today Apollo is still the technology I would pick (especially as it works well within AWS Lambda), but given time I can see AppSync being a fantastic tool for traversing multiple APIs for consumption by a simple (ALB-to-Lambda?) presentation tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://serverless.com/blog/reinvent-2018-serverless-announcements/&quot;&gt;More here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GDS is doing a lot of hiring around Birmingham! And all for good stuff! If you&apos;re around the West Midlands, and are looking for a change of scene, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jobs.jobvite.com/justicedigitalandtechnology/jobs&quot;&gt;defo recommend checking them out&lt;/a&gt;. GDS is [meaningful] digital transformation done right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia’s donations campaign is here now, and its ads are getting more and more annoying, and now follow you around the page. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_redesign&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s how the community approached campaigns 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, big difference from the less transparent presumably more data-driven state of today. (Wow, Wikipedia has been around for an incredibly long time!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/10/22/1540184400000/Subprime-code--a-very-avoidable-crisis/&quot;&gt;Subprime Code&lt;/a&gt;: There is a collective mountain of technical debt being built up. If you thought the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 was bad, this one is going to be the end of us all. Y2K is back.&lt;/li&gt;

My brain has been like jello.
What’s most frustrating is the research and prep-work I tried to avoid the worst effects by attempting to acclimatise ahead of the flight and by deliberately minimising my sleep on the plane to make sure that I’d be exhausted. IT DID NOT WORK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jetlag is a symptom of chronobiology. Us humans are diurnal, meaning we adapted to live around the pattern of solar radiation, normally 24 hours. When we disrupt this, even one system (like say, the digestive system) going out of sync can send every other one haywire. Even if you think you&apos;re fine, jetlag will probably have affected you in some way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JetlagRooster produces sensible plans.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://d.ax.gy/cBCq2b+&quot;&gt;I sort-of stuck to one&lt;/a&gt;  Still did not help.  Maybe there’s something wrong with me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I brought some of my leftover &lt;a href=&quot;https://hvmn.com/yawn&quot;&gt;HVMN Yawn&lt;/a&gt; with me, which proved to be the killer blow on my second night after I spent several hours tossing and turning (whilst stubbornly staying in bed, in a darkened room, praying for sweet, sweet sleep).  Had totally forgotten how good HVMN’s products were, maybe I should buy some more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/17bd2042-2221-11e8-9a70-08f715791301&quot;&gt;Spin City, by Chris Grimes&lt;/a&gt; is easily one of my favourite pieces of writing from this year and mirrors a lot of the same sense of awe and intrigue which has inspired my own interest in Tokyo. Granted walking through Tower Records in Akihabara shortly after landing, the only thing spinning was my head. &quot;Jetlag city&quot;, as it were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antoligy/status/1067682123706904576&quot;&gt;the new NAR homepage, and honestly, it looks pretty great&lt;/a&gt;!  Kudos to everybody involved.  If this sort of thing is of interest to you, both &lt;a href=&quot;https://ft.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/FT_External_Careers&quot;&gt;the FT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluetel.co.uk&quot;&gt;Bluetel are currently hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More quietly I have started looking at tooling to make sure that the content on the homepage is up-to-date, by diffing the latest state from the application logs against the website front-end, to artificially report on whenever something is amiss: This is important because as the dynamic nature of our website means occasional rendering errors are sometimes caught in caches for quite some time.
For anyone building a high-traffic, slow-changing page I strongly recommend building it statically (i.e. when something has changed, and not when a reader has requested the page). The cache-invalidation work required will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be easy, but the resiliency and robustness at that point which come for free from serving a static object &lt;em&gt;almost entirely from cache&lt;/em&gt; will be well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some rough notes ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a webpage (&quot;A&quot;) make sure it is tagged with &lt;em&gt;its own&lt;/em&gt; unique identifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a webpage (&quot;A&quot;) referencing another article (&quot;B&quot;) in any shape or form (e.g. card, teaser or link), tag the webpage (&quot;A&quot;) with the article&apos;s (&quot;B&quot;) unique identifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For an article (&quot;B&quot;) with its own webpage, tag the article (&quot;B&quot;) with its most portable unique identifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the webpage (&quot;A&quot;) changes, purge/rebuild the webpage (&quot;A&quot;) by its own unique identifier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the article (&quot;B&quot;) changes, purge/rebuild the article (&quot;B&quot;) by its own unique identifier and the webpage by the article&apos;s unique identifier (&quot;A&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When adding (or changing) a reference to another article (&quot;C&quot;) in the webpage (&quot;A&quot;), purge/rebuild the webpage (&quot;A&quot;), tagging it with all articles&apos; unique identifiers (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(n.b. Tagging is additive: A page can have multiple tags. e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.varnish-software.com/varnish-cache-plus/vmods/xkey/&quot;&gt;Varnish XKey&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Nikko!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the weekend I took a trip to Nikkō, just north of Tokyo. It&apos;s a stunning place, especially during the autumn: Vibrant shades of deep red ranging through to electric yellow: I&apos;ve never quite seen an autumn like it.  Nikko is home to plenty of stunning scenery, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3812.html&quot;&gt;including many waterfalls&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3814.html&quot;&gt;now disused ceremonial bridge&lt;/a&gt; leading foot traffic out into the middle of a busy road.  However what drew my attention about the area was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3801.html&quot;&gt;Toshugu Shrine&lt;/a&gt; which is known for being the most intricately detailed shrine complex in all of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.alexwilson.tech/20181201--monkeys.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mizaru, Kikazaru and Iwazaru&quot; title=&quot;Mizaru, Kikazaru and Iwazaru&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshugu amongst other things houses an early &quot;See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&quot; carving. It might be one of the earliest depictions of the three monkeys Mizaru, Kikazaru and Iwazaru; however, there is very little reliable information available on the origins of these monkeys.
Reading some literature at the temple, this particular version was carved by Hidari Jingoro and is the 2nd panel of an 8-panel carving telling the story of living a good life.
The story is one of preserving innocence. In this story, &lt;em&gt;children should see no evil, should hear no evil and will speak no evil&lt;/em&gt;. Exposure to any of these carries a negative effect: Seeing or hearing evil, it becomes part of our physical being and becomes us and seeks an outlet in our actions, including speaking evil. So if we see no evil, and hear no evil, there will be no evil in us to speak. We are the sum of our inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading background material on the topic, it certainly seems like there have been some misunderstandings around the general premise of the monkeys. In fact it&apos;s entirely possible that this read is also wrong (&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.gaijinpot.com/see-no-evil-hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil/&quot;&gt;but at least I&apos;m not alone!&lt;/a&gt;). But maybe this is for the best: There&apos;s something quite poetic about these three wise monkeys silently teaching generations life lessons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes — 3rd November 2018]]></title><description><![CDATA[Predominantly this week I’ve been working to reverse engineer, document and test a subscription system.

What should have been a simple handover exercise has turned into an excellent case-study for process improvements around making sure that business-critical systems aren’t only captured in institutional knowledge.  People &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; move on, and so these crucial facts are sometimes lost to time.  It’s a well-equipped team which makes sure that doesn’t cause problems, and a well-equipped team is what we’re trying to build.  &lt;em&gt;Playing BA is fun, sometimes I wish I’d taken that career path.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Definition as a driver of software quality&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently I’ve been thinking a lot about quality in software engineering, and more specifically how to ensure it.  Quality Assurance as a role in a team seems to go through cycles of being undervalued when it’s identified as slowing things down, and then being overvalued when people notice a reduction in quality: I’ve just gone through this cycle myself and am now enamoured with the principles of agile QA (as described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product-ebook/dp/B00NF07FHS&quot;&gt;Jeff Patton and Peter Economy&apos;s User Story Mapping&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing everything that around this topic and looking at the problem of ensuring quality primarily from a &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; perspective, the primary driver seems to be definition: Defining when a feature is done, and what other things need to be considered.  I’ll try to write something more coherent on the matter at a later stage, &lt;em&gt;ideally&lt;/em&gt; with a real-world case-study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Github&apos;s Incident on the 21st of October&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2018-10-30-oct21-post-incident-analysis/&quot;&gt;Github have put together a fantastically detailed RCA&lt;/a&gt; on the service disruption last week. At its core, it was caused by a 43 second network outage which resulted in enough lag to completely throw off Github&apos;s MySQL clustering. The post is fascinating and highly worth a read, and is also an example of the kind of incredible work they&apos;re doing on a day to day basis. However I can&apos;t help but wonder, since GitHub aren&apos;t a MySQL High Availability company, what the cost/benefit to continue rolling their own HA database clustering is. Outages aside, the engineering effort alone must cost a healthy chunk of change, so hopefully the overall storage cost and latency savings are well worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Apple’s October Event&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple’s October event came and went!  A new MacBook Air is making the rounds, and Apple have wisely included the Touch ID sensor in a standard generation 3 keyboard so that it’s still affordable. However it still starts at over $1000.  The new Mac Mini looks like a fantastic desktop experience: I reckon coupled with an eGPU it’ll more than serve as a capable replacement for mine. Nice upgradeability, however incredibly costly for what they actually are.  Overall these compute upgrades are super nice, however it&apos;s very alarming and disappointing that the prices have shot up so much: It seems like Apple is no longer the obvious choice for students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then the iPad Pro: USB-C, an edge-to-edge form factor, and enhanced security; Nearly everything I’ve wanted in a tablet.  If only I could use iOS as a development environment, I’d pick one up in a heartbeat. Also it sounds like the aluminium shavings from manufacturing these are what is going into the new recycled unibodies of the MacBook Air and Mac mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No mention of AirPower.  Zero-surprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, Apple really ought to add haptic feedback to a future version of the TouchBar!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the news this week, things have been pretty hectic: Angela &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/11/03/angela-merkel-will-step-down-as-cdu-party-leader-in-december&quot;&gt;Merkel is stepping down as the leader of the CDU in Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46056337&quot;&gt;Arron Banks is under investigation&lt;/a&gt; by the National Crime Agency for suspected fraud (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/1bbda93c-deb4-11e8-9f04-38d397e6661c&quot;&gt;and the FT has reported&lt;/a&gt;) his business holdings were worth a maximum of £1.75m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Dozens of people around the world were killed because of this.” — If there was ever any doubt as to the importance of internal whistleblowing and taking cyber-security seriously, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yahoo.com/news/cias-communications-suffered-catastrophic-compromise-started-iran-090018710.html&quot;&gt;this story about the CIA neglecting their systems—more importantly their people—should end that&lt;/a&gt;.  No responsibility, or accountability, frankly very outrageous.  On a side-note it’s great to see Yahoo News breaking cybersecurity news: Hopefully after multiple crushing blows, they’ve entered into a new chapter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather quietly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/15/stephen-hawking-feared-race-of-superhumans-able-to-manipulate-their-own-dna/&quot;&gt;Stephen Hawking worried about the side-effects of genetic manipulation&lt;/a&gt;: How even starting out with the best of intentions, a human race given the ability to write its own evolutionary future would inevitably start improving traits to the point of developing a race of so-called “super-humans”, leaving those less able in the proverbial dust.  Flashbacks to Huxley’s Brave New World describes a similar future, in which this is carefully planned: But today we’re not that organised. I hope Huxley and Hawking are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; wrong. I hope we have a kind future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes — 24th November 2018]]></title><description><![CDATA[Prodominantly this week I was preparing for a business trip to Tokyo, which due to friendly entry requirements has always been an incredibly…]]></description><link>https:/alexwilson.tech/content/09d7fcde-61c6-48f7-b68e-1c1be442698f</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https:/alexwilson.tech/content/09d7fcde-61c6-48f7-b68e-1c1be442698f</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2018 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prodominantly this week I was preparing for a business trip to Tokyo, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/japan/entry-requirements&quot;&gt;due to friendly entry requirements&lt;/a&gt; has always been an incredibly pleasant process. I can&apos;t talk too much about the details for this specific trip, but some advice when working between languages and countries: Many technology vendors have subsidaries or regional counterparts who will be happy to work together (obvious example would be Google, Google Japan) be able to communicate amongst themselves and to help translate very specific advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Motivation!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I skipped writing up and publishing any weeknotes. It was by choice and I feel uniquely empowered to have been able to do this: If I stick to the routine I’ll be setting myself up to fail when I inevitably am unable to publish one week.
“Don’t break the chain” is a popular method for building and maintaining habits, popularised by Seinfeld, however I find that loss-aversion tactics have the opposite effect on me: After an initial spell in which I am biased to paying time and attention to the habit I am trying to build or avoid, I find that a single uncontrollable loss/failure won’t only break the streak: It’ll break the entire pattern of behaviour. (“Fall off the wagon”, for idiom friends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On motivation, this article was hugely impactful. It’s amazing how small improvements to the visibility of one’s health and fitness can make such a huge difference. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/394681/how-i-used-technology-to-get-in-the-best-shape-of-my-life-and-save-my-son/&quot;&gt;How I Used Technology to Get in the Best Shape of My Life and Save My Son&lt;/a&gt;.  There’s also a sense of pragmatism that this conveys: You don’t need all the data in the world, just enough to keep you going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;EngineRoom 2018&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineroom.ft.com/2016/05/03/engine-room-live-internal-conference-2016/&quot;&gt;EngineRoom&lt;/a&gt; (Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rikstill&quot;&gt;Rik&lt;/a&gt;!). I &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; the less formal nature that it being an internal conference brought.
There’s a growing trend of technology companies speaking openly and honestly about hard-learned lessons and failures, which I personally find a great deal more interesting (and valuable) than the sales pitches (either for a silver-bullet product, methodology or person) that many technical talks have become.
This was my first experience of an internal conference and it&apos;s a fantastic management practice that other organisations should be doing too. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/blog/academy/organise-first-internal-conference-fds00/&quot;&gt;Here&apos;s some EventBrite marketing material on how to do it&lt;/a&gt;,
and Here are versions of some of the most interesting talks: &lt;a href=&quot;https://24ways.org/2018/what-i-learned-in-six-years-at-gds/&quot;&gt;Anna Shipman—What I Learned in Six Years At GDS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/291584445&quot;&gt;Tyler McMullen—Software Fault Isolation and Edge Computing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H06qrNmGqyE&quot;&gt;Sarah Wells—The Challenges of Migrating 150+ Microservices to Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought an iPad Pro! Thoughts so far:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uni-tasking as the primary experience within a desktop-sized OS is pretty great, it’s really improving my ability to get stuff done and the overall experience is nearly as complete as macOS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A surprisingly large amount of the web has no idea how to treat an iOS browser: Some think I am a desktop, some think I am a large phone, some perform UA/browser detection and determine that I’m running an old browser. (Chrome, iOS, it makes little difference!)  C’mon, we’re better than that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new pen is really quite nice to use, combined with the much better refresh rate I have now switched from Notability to GoodNotes for taking ad-hoc notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no development environments available for iOS, and no_just-about-everybody-cracking-wise-when-I’ve-mentioned-this_remotely connecting to a virtual machine running Linux doesn’t count: ever-present, low-latency internet is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a myth. Plus the iPad is a whole lot more than just a reimagining of a thin-client, those hit their peak a long time ago with big mainframes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the keyboard connector attached, iOS still sometimes opens up the soft keyboard. Which on this screen size is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;command-line-prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;dnssync --provider&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;cloudflare --state&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;state.json
&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt;/11/10 00:34:19 Evaluating: irc.stormbit.net &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; A
&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt;/11/10 00:34:19 Nothing to do&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt;/11/10 00:34:19 Evaluating: irc.stormbit.net &lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; AAAA
&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/span&gt;/11/10 00:34:19 Nothing to do&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by no means the first tool in this space but it does address a few specific needs. It is also exposed both as a command line tool and as an application library which means that it is useful for small automations, as well as more customised and bespoke ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why not use Terraform instead?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terraform is one of my favourite tools: Amongst other things I’m using it to manage my Google Cloud account, and my teams use it for managing and testing our Fastly properties (a topic for another time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s a great first most of the time, Terraform doesn’t fit all use-cases all of the time, and in this case specifically for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/cloudflare/index.html&quot;&gt;managing Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The configuration format for Cloudflare DNS is very brittle: It manages entire zones at a time, meaning you must declare &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; or risk losing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terraform’s management of state-files is notoriously risky in mixed-ability teams which impairs its accessibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terraform isn’t designed for just-in-time dynamic configuration changes. The case may be made that actually a CDN/DNS provider Cloudflare isn’t either, but more modern use-cases of edge infrastructure really rely on it. In fact Cloudflare Workers support dynamic origin selection and Cloudflare Apps support dynamic record alterations, but both only work for HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately DevOps is not about repurposing tools such as Terraform, but about solving operational problems: Here, our use-case was just a little bit too far outside of the remit of anything which already existed, hence the new tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;StormBit’s use of DNSSync&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StormBit is now using DNSSync as a component of its infrastructure modernisation and democratisation efforts.
We use Cloudflare as a DNS provider, because we don’t have the capacity or expertise to run and support our own DNS. The fewer bits of infrastructure we are responsible for, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare doesn’t allow us to have versioned, access controlled access to a particular zone so democractising access to maintain these records has always been a problem with key-man dependencies: This was our main priority, and so now we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stormbit/servicedeploy&quot;&gt;baked DNSSync into&lt;/a&gt; our configuration management toolchain to apply zone state for all types of irc.stormbit.net records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More long-term, as IRC uses DNS for routing users, the library interface exposed by DNSSync allows us to persist the current state of the service registry even as it changes, meaning that these records will be automatically kept up to date whenever IRC servers are added or removed from the pool. For our users, they won’t ever be routed to unhealthy nodes and that’s pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab DNSSync and its source here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stormbit/dnssync&quot;&gt;DNSSync&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After neglecting it for a long time, StormBit’s DNS is now partially automated. I built a new tool for idempotently managing DNS records within a zone, and have hooked it into the same CI process which manages and distributes server configurations, meaning that now DNS is completely democratised. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/blog/2018/11/10/democratising-and-automating-dns/&quot;&gt;I’ve written up some of the reasoning and methodology here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In actually building this thing there was the opportunity to start using Golang 1.11 modules which turn out to be seamless, hassle-free and actually incredibly awesome if also poorly documented. Really fantastic that there’s so much investment of time and effort into improving Golang’s developer experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reflections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week I have been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0141033576&quot;&gt;Thinking: Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt; and it provides a great model for examining interactions. Aside from prompting me to reexamine many concepts and conversations which I have taken as &quot;just so&quot;, because I may have avoided exerting the effort to check their logical consistency, I have lately become so easily distractible that I have forgotten the joy and value of reading. As a theme for coming weeks, I will be paying more attention to my energy levels and to trying to introduce unitasking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week has also been pretty rough. Maybe it’s related to the clocks going back and is an early indication of SAD but motivation feels harder. On the upside, &lt;a href=&quot;gyrosco.pe&quot;&gt;Gyrosco.pe&lt;/a&gt; have updated their mood tracking and have (apparently) added a feature to nag mood check-ins, so hopefully I’ll be able to get some useful data out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was my mother’s birthday this week and together with my sister we out for dinner to celebrate. It’s kind-of surreal how different the dynamic is now that we’re all a group of adults, leading entirely and completely different lives. I suppose it’s not that big a deal since every other family will have gone through this same transition at some stage, but it’s quite remarkable to have gone through it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loads of good conferences on this week: In no particular order, &lt;em&gt;Sharp intake of breath&lt;/em&gt;. FFConf, PerfNow, WebPerfDays Amsterdam, muConf, SeaGL, DACHFest and P3X. Seems like by far this was this busiest conf week all year! Wish I could’ve gone to most of these because they all sounded awesome: Oh well, at least I got to play with a JamBoard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holy carp there’s a lot of hype going on right now about React Hooks. Haven’t had a chance to look yet, but going by &lt;a href=&quot;https://codesandbox.io/embed/387p7vo9z5&quot;&gt;examples like this one, implementing slider interactions&lt;/a&gt; we may see much more portable user experience pattern libraries springing up. Also these seem like a good replacement for mixins?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nodegirlslondon/status/1061306448125267974&quot;&gt;The FT hosted NodeGirlsLondon today&lt;/a&gt;. Nice work to everybody involved!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Black Friday coming up, an interesting tidbit came up during conversation this week: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/juokaz/status/1061367299918217217&quot;&gt;Singles Day generated $3B for AliBaba in just a couple of minutes&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t help but wonder how much revenue will be generated this season. At peak, $1 million per minute was spent last year. Can we top that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/11/03/japanese-island-quietly-disappeared-no-one-noticed-until-now/&quot;&gt;Missing: The island of Esanbehanakitakojima. Have you seen it?&lt;/a&gt; In all seriousness, coastal erosion is scary and climate change is making it happen quicker.  And it’s happening—rather quietly—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45983260&quot;&gt;at an unprecedented rate in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t know about you but I’m not a fantastic swimmer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Going to give publishing weeknotes a try. &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/what-on-earth-are-weeknotes-a81874c5cef9&quot;&gt;Weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; are something that have been quietly popping up, and they’re essentially a journal-style blog post reflecting on a given week. They can be as personal, or impersonal as the writer likes. There’s no fixed cadence, so missing a couple of weeks here or there is no biggie, but they’re great ways of reflecting on a week. I’ll be starting by taking some of the ad-hoc notes and links I normally jot in Bear throughout the week, and running from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speedcurve and WPT are fantastic for debugging problems, but Puppeteer on its own might be an even better Swiss-army-knife for improving WebPerf (especially in local environments): &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaljanaszek.com/blog/test-website-performance-with-puppeteer&quot;&gt;Michał Janaszek has a great article on the subject&lt;/a&gt; with useful examples and I love this candlestick chart comparing different scenarios against different network states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe obvious but still important: Saying problems are “hard” or “difficult” to a person sounds like we’re being lazy. Better to explain the reasons why something is hard, framed in a way that makes sense to that particular person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Riiiiiight, it’s ITIL time! An &lt;em&gt;Incident&lt;/em&gt; is disruption to service [whether customer impacting, or not], a &lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt; is the cause of multiple incidents. A good analogy for complex systems is that of &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt;: Having a runny nose is potentially a &lt;em&gt;symptom&lt;/em&gt; caused by suffering from the flu, and the &lt;em&gt;symptom&lt;/em&gt; can be treated with certain medicine—A runny nose is an &lt;em&gt;incident&lt;/em&gt; that can be solved, but the underlying &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; of a flu will persist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Python is the second-best language for everything”: This is an old saying which has stuck in my head for a while, recently resurfaced during &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITksU31c1WY&quot;&gt;Dan Callahan&apos;s Keynote at PyCon2018&lt;/a&gt;.  As far as languages go, of the few I’ve dealt with, it’s not one I have particularly enjoyed, and so I’ve shied away from really learning and using it properly. And yet quote still really rings true. Between all these complicated provisioning shell scripts with snippets of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt;, I’d much rather see them written Python because it’s imperative, syntactically consistent and easily testable: More approachable to an outsider. I think I should invest more time in learning Python.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Maidment&apos;s talk at Thursday&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://brumphp.uk&quot;&gt;BrumPHP&lt;/a&gt; on &quot;Handling Exponential Growth with ElasticSearch&quot; was an interesting and refreshingly honest insight on how a tech stack may already hide the answer to new problems, as well as some hard truths about how &quot;better&quot; performance can already be enough. &lt;a href=&quot;http://civico.net/brumtech/brumphp/4275&quot;&gt;You can watch it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/24&quot;&gt;Games Done Quick Express&lt;/a&gt; is on this weekend, in support of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitchcon.tiltify.com/&quot;&gt;TwitchCon Charity Plaza&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Neat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It turns out though that you can have too much of a good thing as many have learned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/01/aws_s3_outage/&quot;&gt;including Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and recently I have run into a reminder that S3’s API still leaves a little to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My use-case was pretty simple.  I had a bucket with about 2.5 million objects and needed to update the ACL on these objects to make them publicly readable.  Simple enough ... right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually I would approach such a task by changing the bucket policies to apply to all objects regardless of their own ACLs, yet here I did not have the option to change the bucket policies, and even so, this would have caused problems for any systems relying upon canned Object ACLs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a small program in Go to recursively update S3 object permissions to any canned ACL.  It’s documented and downloadable here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexwilson/s3-recursive-acl/&quot;&gt;https://github.com/alexwilson/s3-recursive-acl/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this is useful as it stands, and I am keen to hear any suggestions on how I can improve the methodology (did I miss something?) as well as the program itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more notes on how I came to this conclusion, and general thoughts on S3 and Golang after the break!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attempt #1 — Read the docs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s documentation is very comprehensive when you know where to look.  Sadly, I could not find anything that helped.  Ask around AWS practitioners and Solutions Architects the consensus was that I might need to write something custom to solve this problem.  Grr, but maybe there is something, and it&apos;s just buried deep within the docs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file operations beneath the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;aws s3&lt;/code&gt;  command line, it makes sense that there’s nothing oriented towards modifying AWS ACL in here.  I was a bit disappointed that there was nothing beneath the S3API itself, however, as recursively changing permissions (still) seems like a reasonable use-case!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that the documentation is fairly conclusive, which is pretty refreshing given the spurious nature of documentation in competing services.  I’m hoping that a future version of the S3 API might introduce this functionality or something analogous to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attempt #2 — Try to recursively update all Object metadata&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a bit silly.  Various StackOverflow answers for tangentially related problems suggest that something like this might work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;command-line-prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;aws s3 &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;cp&lt;/span&gt; --metadata &lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;FOO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;bar --recursive --acl public-read --profile test--prod s3://test-bucket-2/files/ s3://test-bucket-2/files/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t as no metadata was being changed.  It could have been an ideal approach as no API calls would need to be made from my machine for this operation to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attempt #3 — Start instrumenting the S3 API myself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;putObjectAcl&lt;/code&gt; is super nice as far as API methods go.  It’s a full PUT for a given object, but only for its metadata, so all I need to know is the key and the new ACL document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To save some time I started looking at the SDKs and quickly found the stellar work in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/&quot;&gt;Golang SDK&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s got the same base functionality as other SDKs, but with nice features such as automatic pagination (which is a huge time-saver especially in AWS where pagination can be non-linear and involves keeping track of tokens) and not enforcing a particular concurrency model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed ideal as it allowed me to implement a simplistic, yet elegant, approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate over pages of 1000 objects at a time, recursively listing by a given key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spin-off Goroutines to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;putObjectACL&lt;/code&gt; for each child key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for the Goroutines to complete before exiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could’ve done something nicer here such as implementing a proper worker pool pattern, however, my batch sizes and concurrency requirements aren’t yet nearly large enough to justify this.  Maybe this is a possible improvement for the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goroutines were essential with this approach as it had to perform well. I effectively ran 2.5 thousand API calls to list the objects in this bucket and a further 2.5 million API calls to update those object permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it ran &lt;em&gt;beautifully&lt;/em&gt;.  In just over an hour all 2.5 million objects had the correct ACL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;command-line-prompt&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-user=alex data-host=localhost&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;AWS_PROFILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;test--profile ./s3-recursive-acl --bucket test-bucket-1 --region ap-northeast-1 --path test/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Go-tchas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not specific to this particular project, there are a few things in Golang that will definitely throw people off which I addressed whilst writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing pointers to Goroutines is very risky as the pointers can and will be reassigned.  &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt; make a copy of the true value you want first.  You can convert formats within the Goroutine itself if performance is a concern (in order not to block).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token boolean&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; object &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; page&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Contents &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Make a copy of the value allocated to the pointer before we do anything with it!&lt;/span&gt;
            key &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;object&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;Key
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goroutines logically run outside of the main scope of the application, and while this means sometimes they will run concurrently in the main thread, the application will not wait for Goroutines to complete, so you can’t guarantee that your operations will even run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup&quot;&gt;WaitGroup&lt;/a&gt; was added to the sync standard library to solve this problem, and it is ridiculously simple to get up and running with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instantiate a WaitGroup, and instruct the application to block until the WaitGroup is terminated.  For every non-blocking operation that is spun up, increment the WaitGroup counter, and then reduce it when the operations complete.  This approach works well and has virtually no footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;go&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-go&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Create a WaitGroup&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; wg sync&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;WaitGroup

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Ask the WaitGroup to wait.&lt;/span&gt;
        wg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Do some work here.&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Tell the WaitGroup we&apos;re done&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;defer&lt;/span&gt; wg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot;&gt;// Block until our tasks are done.&lt;/span&gt;
    wg&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;Wait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that S3 is this simple to orchestrate.  Being able to make this many Object Metadata changes this quickly (2.5 million objects in just over an hour?  That’s ~600req/s!) without being throttled is pretty spectacular. (I’m sure that running this actually within an EC2 in the same region would make this quicker)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: Golang is invaluable for writing these super-performant scripts.  Every time I’ve had the chance to use it to tackle a problem, I’ve found it intuitive and quick to write and run.  I hope to have more of opportunities to use it in future work.  I’m thankful that I took the time to look at other options and languages first otherwise I wouldn’t have been done so quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a chance to try out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://glide.sh/&quot;&gt;Glide packaging system&lt;/a&gt; for this project, and it is really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; nice.  Recommended for projects of all shapes and sizes, and I will be using it for my future Golang hacks!&lt;/p&gt;

networking to their compute offering!  This is fantastic news, and I recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ipv6-support-for-ec2-instances-in-virtual-private-clouds/&quot;&gt;Jeff Barr&apos;s
post for more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my excitement died down a bit after finding that there isn&apos;t yet much information about
getting off the ground with IPv6.  Ultimately it was pretty intuitive but it did require a bit of fumbling
around in the AWS console.  I&apos;ve documented the full process here, so hopefully I&apos;ll be able to save you
some time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;AWS abbreviations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;AZ - Availability Zone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGW - Internet Gateway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;SG - Security Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;VPC - Virtual Private Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuring a VPC to support IPv6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Currently this is only available in the Ohio region (us-east-2) .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1) Add IPv6 CIDR to the VPC itself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default everybody gets one VPC per region.  If you&apos;ve set-up other VPCs, these instructions
will still work - you will just need to replicate custom routing in step #4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every default VPC comes with a default IPv4 /16.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the &quot;Edit CIDRs&quot; page for each VPC, it&apos;s possible to allocate an IPv6 /56 to your VPC.
Note that this is random, and unlike the IPv4 /16 which is strictly internal, this CIDR is
comprised of public IP addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2) Add IPv6 to VPC subnets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default there&apos;s one subnet per Availability Zone, IPv4 only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Associate a subnet of the IPv6 CIDR we&apos;ve just assigned to the VPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3) Enable IPv6 auto-assign in subnets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default each subnet will auto-allocate IPv4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From auto-assign IP settings, enable IPv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4) Update VPC route table to add IPv6 route to the IGW.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, VPC route tables have &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0/0&lt;/code&gt; routed through a default Internet Gateway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to add a route with a Destination of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;::/0&lt;/code&gt; through the IGW.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5) Adjust Security Groups to allow IPv6 connections.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both newly created and historic SGs come with IPv4 rules pre-configured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will want to add new rules for inbound and outbound IPv6 connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same pattern as before, and in regions which support IPv6 you&apos;ll find that new defaults
have been added for IPv6 wildcards.  Unfortunately, you will have to double-up on rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For inbound traffic, you can edit your existing rules and add the appropriate IPv6 CIDR to the end,
separated by a comma.  e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0/0&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;0.0.0.0/0, ::/0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concerning outbound IPv6, it may be set up by default, if so you can safely skip the rest of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should be safe to allow all outbound traffic, using the same IPv6 CIDR as above!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When altering existing outbound SG rules, at the very least make sure to enable IPv6 ICMP
traffic, as it is used to replace ARP in IPv6!  Unfortunately I learned this the hard way :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s it, you&apos;re done!
Congratulations, your region is now IPv6 enabled.
Before you can use this with Compute resources there may be a little more set-up required...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using IPv6 in Compute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most EC2 images will not support IPv6 out of the box, as AWS assigns IPv6 via DHCPv6 (and not SLAAC)
and at time of writing only the AMI for Amazon Linux has been updated to support this.
In-time, it&apos;s inevitable others will follow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a running instance you can do this manually with: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;dhclient -v -6 -N&lt;/code&gt;.
However, to survive reboots, you will want to modify the definition of your network interface so that
it can be assigned an IPv6 address via DHCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Debian / Ubuntu&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Debian-like systems such as Ubuntu this can be achieved by creating a definition in &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/etc/network/interfaces.d/&lt;/code&gt;.
(On older systems you&apos;ll have to modify &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/etc/network/interfaces&lt;/code&gt; directly.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;iface eth0 inet6 dhcp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can automate this with userdata when creating a new image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token shebang important&quot;&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;iface eth0 inet6 dhcp&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; /etc/network/interfaces.d/99-eth0-ipv6-dhcp.cfg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Redhat / CentOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Redhat systems such as CentOS this is a little different, and you&apos;ll need to edit the network
script for eth0. &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;IPV6INIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;yes
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;IPV6_AUTOCONF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;no
&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot;&gt;DHCPV6C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extras!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&apos;s also possible to use IPv6 internally, and to completely prevent inbound internet traffic.
This involves the creation of a new &quot;Egress Only Internet Gateway&quot;, which is essentially
an IGW with a built in SG.
After creating one of these, route &quot;::/0&quot; through this new gateway, instead of through a pre-existing one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will update this post with CloudFormation configuration as soon as it is possible, as well as with some further thoughts and reflections on using this as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with everything, your mileage may vary.  That being said, if you have any questions or feedback, please don&apos;t hesitate to drop me a line.

All on a Friday afternoon, and at the end of it all I&apos;m left feeling exhausted.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why choose “ten deploys per day” as the title of this post?  Ten has been something of a magic number to me: After having seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdOe18KhtT4&quot;&gt;John Allspaw and Paul Hammond&apos;s talk on the subject&lt;/a&gt; and after having read Gene Kim&apos;s excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00AZRBLHO&quot;&gt;Phoenix Project&lt;/a&gt;, ten seems like a number at which point deployments stop really being a problem - It becomes the point at which developers feel like they have full autonomy over shipping their code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all some context: Around midday on Thursday, my team received a notification that for legal reasons, certain changes needed to be made across an entire estate of web products by this weekend.  Those changes were trivial, but their complexity was expounded by the fact that they needed to be separately applied to ten distinctly different products.  Altering the various codebases was relatively easy, and aside from a slight hiccup with a third party vendor we were quickly able to get those changes out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s not what I want to talk about.  Instead, I want to talk about how to go from having barely achieved ten, to making it a boring norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change management shouldn&apos;t feel like an inconvenience or a chore.&lt;/strong&gt;  Most immediately I felt incredibly frustrated by the number of hoops that filling out change requests entailed: For a high risk deployment, it&apos;s useful to know in advance that something is going to happen, however in this case I was releasing trivial changes and so having to fill out ten forms in order to release feels like an unnecessary extra step.  Maybe this is something which, for further trivial changes, should be automated with the deployment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate all the things!&lt;/strong&gt;  I was incredibly lucky that a few weeks ago I moved the last of these products to Jenkins.  While many were running simple Capistrano wrappers, the remainder used a streamlined set of shell scripts designed to build, run tests and then deploy between dev, test and production environments.  Moving the last of the Capistrano deployments to Jenkins cut deployment times down from ~15-25 minutes, to ~5-10, which made all the difference.  Between these products, I was able to stick to 15 minute deployment windows with minimal hiccups.  Essentially this halved the amount of time it would have taken, and some of the more ancient deployment processes of other teams can sometimes take hours.  Automating those will make everybody happier, and will save significantly more time.  I&apos;ll end this with a thought from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/skamille&quot;&gt;Camille Fournier&lt;/a&gt; - “When you see a process which is more about &quot;How?&quot; than &quot;What?&quot;, then ask yourself what can be automated”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated testing would have helped.&lt;/strong&gt;  Unfortunately for most of these products, the extent of their testing suites were syntax checking tools, meaning that while everything seemed okay I had to manually check each product as it was deployed - Usually by having to cachebust.  With a great volume of deployments, this step feels unnecessary.  For low volume deployments, the usual spiel applies, wherein functional tests allow for quicker and safer development with manual testing boiling down to a simplistic &quot;rubber stamp&quot;.  Again, ensuring that these are instituted across the board will make everybody happier, especially when faced with days as challenging as today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always ensure that there is a fallback for when third party resources become unavailable.&lt;/strong&gt;  While this might seem incredibly obvious, in my experience not many people really pay attention to this.  A few months ago the NodeJS world was rocked by the author of a very simplistic module unpublishing his module from npmjs.org - This immediately broke a lot of build processes causing a lot of confusion, but the longer term consequences were potentially more severe as anybody could have reclaimed that namespace &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm&quot;&gt;which that the Snyk team have written about in detail&lt;/a&gt;.  However, security and practicality concerns aside, what about when the network fails?  What about when internal DNS is down for maintenance?  Tests, builds and deployments should remain unaffected by this, and having to rely on developer heroics in order to get some code deployed to production is flat-out scary! (Ask me over a drink sometime!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure that there&apos;s a fallback plan for when external resources fail.&lt;/strong&gt;  Am I repeating myself?  Maybe, but this time I&apos;d like to ask - What if your authentication service (or git repository, or CI server) goes down?  In my case I needed to make a late change and unfortunately LDAP had gone wrong, with nobody around to fix it, meaning that I effectively had no access except to a single Jenkins box.  Suddenly that service has become a single point of failure, and when there are multiple streams of deployments ongoing, that outage can become a huge, stressful blocker.  While Github was under attack earlier this year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9275041&quot;&gt;many were at a standstill&lt;/a&gt; as they did not have fallbacks for their SCM and deployments - I&apos;d wager that a great deal many quickly were able to set-up alternatives on BitBucket thanks to the distributed nature of git - but even then, it should not have happened.  N+1 resiliency is nothing new, but it seems to have been forgotten in the age of SaaS and SOA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I couldn&apos;t have done it alone.&lt;/strong&gt;  From doing the original work and getting it all signed off, to preparing everything for release, without the team I simply could not have done any of this alone.  Ten deployments alone might have seemed a feat, but having the confidence and trust that what I was releasing was up to my own high standards saved enough time and reassured me enough to let this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be prepared to delay a deployment in case something is wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;  This one is definitely my fault: I take automated deployments for granted, and if something goes wrong with the automation (likely for one of the reasons above) I will immediately attempt to fix it instead of moving onto the next deployment when its window rolls around.  Given that it&apos;s all automated, it&apos;s probably not too late to back out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&apos;s so special about Fridays anyway?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Oh no he didn&apos;t!&lt;/em&gt;  I am going to continue adhering as strictly as possible to &lt;a href=&quot;http://isitreadonlyfriday.com/&quot;&gt;Read-Only-Fridays&lt;/a&gt;, but I feel like the security and processes in-place today are close to the point at which we won&apos;t need to worry about what day of the week it is, or indeed what time it is.  If it&apos;s not okay to break a system on a Friday as it&apos;ll require you to stay late, why is it okay to do the same on the Monday or Wednesday that week?  The day of the week seems like a scapegoat for dysfunctional developmental processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&apos;t all sunshine and roses, but ultimately I&apos;m pretty proud of having accomplished this.  My first full-scale deployment was a whole-day ordeal which involved several people, a snowflake environment and a week of clean-up for the whole team.  To have gone from that to having achieved the magical number of ten in a &lt;em&gt;single afternoon&lt;/em&gt; feels like we&apos;ve come a very long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next steps, I&apos;m hoping to tackle some of the points I&apos;ve outlined above and to take the lessons we&apos;ve learned back to other teams, as well as maybe even pushing forward all the more.  I&apos;m particularly excited by the prospects of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NST3u-GjjFw&quot;&gt;ChatOps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/ArjanSchaaf/zero-downtimejavadeploymentswithdockerandkubernetes&quot;&gt;canary deployments using containers&lt;/a&gt;, so watch this space - Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is IRC technology flexible enough to scale?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Update: October 28th 2018 When I talk about scalability here, it's a wider focus than avoiding hard bottlenecks in the form of networks.

&lt;p&gt;When I talk about scalability here, it&apos;s a wider focus than avoiding hard bottlenecks in the form of networks. It was not something which I expressed very well, so I will try again: Scalability in a technology project also includes aspects of how theses systems work for an entire team, and frankly, in traditional IRC set-ups this is an area which is very lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It requires a team to have access to the systems they need, as well as the operational knowledge to maintain them, all while keeping tight security. It&apos;s a very tight balance and one I don&apos;t think any open organisations have proven that they manage very well: In fact, an appearance of stability usually hides one or many key-man dependencies behind the scenes, and a lot of (hopefully documented) institutional knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general terms this is manifested by service disruption, and in IRC, by frequent netsplits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I was noting some of the thoughts I&apos;d had at the time, thoughts which proved a little too ambitious for an open project. However since then some smaller, more practical steps have been taken, with many more coming. Hopefully this will make our implementation of &lt;em&gt;IRC technology flexible enough to scale&lt;/em&gt;, within our organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for IRC itself, there&apos;s lots of great work happening with &lt;a href=&quot;https://ircv3.net/&quot;&gt;IRCv3&lt;/a&gt; which I strongly encourage any passers-by to follow and contribute to and I&apos;m hoping someone will finally build that P2P &quot;mesh-net&quot; server-to-server protocol. 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original post, as written in late 2015, remains below after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time now I have led a small IRC network which a great deal many people call home.  Overall it has been a very rewarding experience, and I&apos;ve gained many useful technical and managerial skills, however it&apos;s not all sunshine and roses.  Perhaps one of my biggest pet peeves with the current state of IRC is something that I would very much like to improve, and that is the practical scalability of IRC. (i.e. not just more users, but more developers/staff and coping with quick changes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a bit of background, the vast majority of IRC networks run servers following a star topology, on hand-configured/secured servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Hub 1
|-- Leaf A
|-- Hub 2
| |- Services
| |- Leaf B
| `- Leaf C
`-- Leaf D&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this has always made sense, but then what happens if a central node (i.e. in this diagram, &quot;Hub 2&quot;) goes down?  Massive service disruption.  Even if someone has thought ahead and has set up automatic fallback routes and servers, there are other mission-critical components in a traditional IRC network such as the services and security application servers which, should they be available on a network, massively enhance the experience offered by a network and may include fundamental features that users have come to expect from a particular network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many networks, including Rizon and StormBit, this type of disruption - known as a netsplit - is considered the most unpopular aspect of the overall service.  To a robust community they are definite dealbreakers and understandably so, after all who wants to be in the middle of a conversation (or heated debate!) only for half of the participants to go up in smoke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, going by &lt;a href=&quot;http://stormbit.net/2016/01/17/year-of-the-monkey.html&quot;&gt;the 2015 user survey&lt;/a&gt; the greatest cause of dissatisfaction (a whopping 56%) with StormBit&apos;s service was the downtime and disruption caused by netsplits, with similar numbers from 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately there&apos;s no easy way of escaping this type of disruption, and while many networks benefit from running on robust infrastructure with very stable internet connectivity, it seems fairly backwards that this should continue to be the best answer, especially considering the snowflake state that these sorts of servers often fall into, and the reliance on many points of failure that are non-trivial to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is not at all a new topic, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/randybias/architectures-for-open-and-scalable-clouds#20&quot;&gt;Randy Bias gave a talk in 2012&lt;/a&gt; on scalability advocating a distinction between the approach of treating servers as &quot;pets&quot;, in which servers are set-up, maintained, updated and repaired by hand; and treating servers as being &quot;cattle&quot;, where all of these processes are managed through automation (for instance, configuration management tools such as Puppet, Ansible or Chef) meaning that if and when problems arise, new servers can be spun up in seconds, not weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since some of the largest IRC networks in the world, such as QuakeNet and EFNet, have survived for decades following the older practices, the former method of treating servers as pets has proven to be successful however I do not doubt for a second that their infrastructures have become tangled snowflakes, painful to maintain or support.  Ancient practices have not held back technological progress in other areas, so why should they here?  IRC is still run today as it was in its infancy despite much progress in operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the protocols used to communicate between IRC servers, these have come a really long way since the original network.  A major modern contender is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/charybdis-ircd/charybdis/blob/master/doc/technical/ts6-protocol.txt&quot;&gt;TS6 protocol&lt;/a&gt; which, for example, introduces concepts designed around tagging individual servers, clients and messages with unique IDs and timestamps to ease the complexity of propagating information to new servers, to ensure that messages are delivered to clients correctly and to try and reduce desynchronisation between servers - especially when attempting to resolve the differences after an outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is still very much centered around the idea of a star topology, and to my knowledge, all of these protocols still involve a full resynchronisation of the entire state of the network on every link, which in a production network can result in massive amounts of unnecessary information being distributed over the presence of users and channels which aren&apos;t necessarily prudent.  An example here would be a server carrying 60 users rejoining a network with 10000 users; it&apos;s highly unlikely that each of the new users is going to have a common point of contact with the remaining 10k, so why tell this server about users that are not relevant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of inefficiency seems irrational considering the progress that the IRCv3 protocol has made over the original, introducing advanced functionality such as progressive client enhancement, and SASL.  Slowly but surely we&apos;ve been seeing movement in the world of IRC clients, most certainly accelerated by the dawn of other chat platforms such as Slack which are growing in success proving that IRC&apos;s relative user unfriendliness and lack of features are the only reason it is seeing a supposed decline.  The technology itself is fairly primitive and works quite well, but the basic nature of clients pushes away users who value convenience above all else.  However there hasn&apos;t been much movement in the backend side here, as I hope I have made clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ambitious goal of running a self-repairing, auto-scaling service for the future, at StormBit our recent architectural goal has been to build a new network to address these concerns from the very beginning - hosted primarily in a high-availability cloud environment.  We are relatively undecided about which IRC daemon to use; currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inspircd.org&quot;&gt;InspIRCd&lt;/a&gt; is our choice as it allows for an unstructured linking set-up by means of its TS6-like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inspircd.org/wiki/Modules/spanningtree/Protocol.html&quot;&gt;spanning tree protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While no decision has yet been made about exactly which hosting provider to go with, the most popular choices at time of writing are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; and the rather stellar &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt;.  Both have advantages, but the most important aspects to the selection process are an uptime guarantee, API access for automating provisioning systems, and the ability to communicate via a private network.  A number of providers fit the bill, but there are also questions on convenience and operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of technologies, Docker seems to fit the bill for running the systems themselves, as it allows us to generate identical artefacted copies of systems to run on all boxes.  While there are questions over the viability of distributing an &lt;em&gt;entire operating system&lt;/em&gt; just to run a handful of applications, it also ensures that there&apos;s no possibility of introducing snowflake environments and leaves us feeling safer than relying purely on configuration management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously it&apos;s still a requirement to store the state of the network (i.e. which servers are available) somewhere, and so we have opted to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consul.io/&quot;&gt;HashiCorp Consul&lt;/a&gt; to allow automatic discovery of new nodes introduced into our cluster, and to adjust our round-robin DNS, both by means of the rather excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template&quot;&gt;consul-template&lt;/a&gt; which allows applications that remain unaware of service registries to interact with them near natively.
Consul also offers us decent monitoring abilities, and so I have written a small utility in Go to perform a simplistic healthcheck on IRC servers, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/StormBit/ircd-healthcheck&quot;&gt;ircd-healthcheck&lt;/a&gt;.  This should be readily usable with other monitoring systems too, a few solutions already exist but none that I could easily make work with Consul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For future improvements, we are looking at alternative IRCd technology, and the option of better integrating an external server registry into InspIRCd by means of a custom module - so watch this space for that!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I feel like there&apos;s plenty of room in this space for better approaches to automatically scale IRC, and to future-proof it in terms of practices.  If anything, the approach that we are taking at StormBit just to improve our resiliency seems like overkill and is definitely daunting to other networks of lower technical ability or of greater size.  I&apos;m hoping that this article might spark some conversations about how to start catching up to the technical proficiency of our relatives in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

Sure, it&apos;s the first thing people see when they look me up, but even that isn&apos;t enough to prioritize it above my more interesting projects, both paid and otherwise.  However I have finally gone ahead and done it, and have now finished rebuilding my website only a year and a half after I said I would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before saying anything else, here is what my site had looked like since mid-2013: &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/Ziq7Z3Jl.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive align-center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first decision when rebuilding was centered around the nature of my website: What do I need my website to show, and &lt;em&gt;what is it actually used for&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; have fast-changing, dynamic content, and what I do want to serve isn&apos;t remotely user dynamic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; need to sell anything, so considering e-commerce is silly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However I want to serve content that I will write occasionally (or regularly), for the world to see my thoughts, ramblings and musings on various topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would also like to display some information on what I&apos;ve been working on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe also put up a small profile for people to find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what needs to be dynamic on a website these days can actually be achieved in the browser through JavaScript - especially given the dawn of service workers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/&quot;&gt;Jake Archibald has written an excellent post on the subject here&lt;/a&gt;), but even then I don&apos;t actually need to do all that much, so there&apos;s no reason to complicate things with a dynamic website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github have been running their Github Pages service on a static site generator called &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, which I&apos;ve previously used to build the StormBit website, and other smaller projects.  It uses text-based storage, in the form of structured markdown documents, plus the Liquid templating language used by Shopify, so seemed perfect for my needs.  Plus, free hosting for the site, with git for source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having settled on my hosting platform, and framework, the question was what should the site actually look like, and how should I build it?&lt;br /&gt;
I&apos;ve already experience with frameworks like Foundation and 960gs, but ultimately I wanted something simple, but extensible.  Twitter&apos;s bootstrap is particularly powerful, however I&apos;ve never been a fan of jQuery as I feel it encourages poor practice and covers too much ground that should just be polyfilled (expect more on this in a future post), so immediately discounted it.  That is until I made the now-regrettable decision to buy this theme:
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rhry5Ye.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the entire theme was written in LESS, so I had to convert it to Sass (which was a fairly painless task).  However after hacking at it a while, I realised that it was a stupid idea which relied on very different requirements to what I was trying to build and tore the entire thing down and started from scratch, on the design you are seeing now.  I again raised the question of Bootstrap vs. other frameworks, but then found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thednp.github.io/bootstrap.native/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap.Native&lt;/a&gt; project which settled my doubts there and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how simple the site is, I felt it needed something to help it stand out from most other sides.  The background colour gives the site a lot of flavor and warmth, I chose it after digging around and looking at what other sites were doing.  I&apos;ve been a huge fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized&quot;&gt;Ethan Schnoover&apos;s Solarized&lt;/a&gt; for years, and wanted to do something similar, so I built an entire palette around shades of Orange, brown and grey.  I think the overall result is fairly aesthetically pleasing, and plus is very simple to build on- In fact the entire palette is calculated automatically using Sass&apos;s darken() feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing I should really touch on is that later in I decided to try and use PJAX for the site as much as possible, and in particular a library called InstantClick which pre-loads pages on mouseover to reduce the latency between pages.  While I didn&apos;t really have any issues with page load times (I built the entire thing using Chrome&apos;s throttling, set to 50kbps), coupled with CSS animations on links, this site feels virtually instant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting past CloudFlare]]></title><description><![CDATA[CloudFlare is a wonderful thing.

An excellent DNS provider coupled with a hosted &quot;intelligent&quot; caching reverse proxy? Sign me up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some of the functionality offered up by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.CloudFlare.com/&quot; title=&quot;CloudFlare&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; can only be described as awesome - From the ability to project a WAF over your entire site, to automatically minifying all static assets, to even offer a proprietary ESI alternative in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.CloudFlare.com/railgun&quot;&gt;RailGun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CloudFlare has powered my site, that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stormbit.net/&quot; title=&quot;CloudFlare&quot;&gt;StormBit&lt;/a&gt;, the Pomf.se hosting service and countless others that I&apos;ve been involved with over the past few years and all without a single hitch.  Alongside saving us bandwidth and offering lighting-fast DNS updates, unlimited DNS entries and flexible SSL, it has also kept sites serving content even when they have been down, or under heavy load.  With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.CloudFlare.com/&quot; title=&quot;CloudFlare&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt; I can honestly say that small websites finally have a way of ensuring sites don&apos;t suffer the Slashdot effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this is not intended to be an advert for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.CloudFlare.com/&quot; title=&quot;CloudFlare&quot;&gt;CloudFlare&lt;/a&gt;.  Rather I have been hit with their &quot;I&apos;m under attack mode&quot;, which is all well and good when one is actually under attack as it almost completely negates the ability of bots to hit applications and make away with precious bandwidth.  Unfortunately I&apos;m not quite a bot, and instead of trying to steal bandwidth or steal email addresses, I&apos;m trying to scrape information (for playlists) from websites which is at least a tiny bit less insidious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over how CloudFlare decides whether or not I am a bot, it evaluates Javascript in the browser to solve a challenge, and this challenge is per-domain, per-IP, per-session and per-useragent so I can&apos;t just solve the challenge once and add it to all my cookie jars.  Additionally, there is no sane way of manually adding all of the required cookies to new cookie jars, so that&apos;s not an option either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most immediate thought was to try and solve by guessing patterns and capturing values with regular expressions, however CloudFlare&apos;s engineers are several steps ahead and are actually obfuscating their challenge payload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying a bit of trickery in node.js to try and capture and evaluate the challenge, I realised that there&apos;s already a far simpler way around this- Using a browser testing engine such as PhantomJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, I had whipped together the following, which at time of writing allows my scraping tools past CloudFlare with negligable failures.&lt;/p&gt;
