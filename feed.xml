&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, in the heat I walked around the entire city through every park â€” including some I hadnâ€™t visited while out there. South Park is lovely!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between catching-up &amp;amp; work, I also did a midterm exercise on Algorithms: The hardest part was revising pseudocode! ðŸ˜…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately though not all was good, and politics came to a head resulting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/bulgarian-government-faces-no-confidence-vote-political-turmoil-2022-06-22/&quot;&gt;government shutdown&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the US supreme court, in a heartbreaking regression to human rights, has put many in medical peril. RMT in the UK are also fighting for workers rights. Thereâ€™s a strange energy in the air right now.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/3e44c675-e425-4af4-953d-2c2ed4315b27?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to be a CTO: Lessons from LeadingEng 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently I was lucky enough to attend LeadingEng London, hereâ€™s what I learned.

&lt;p&gt;LeadingEng is a new conference aimed at VP/Director/CTO level engineering leaders by the organisers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a more intimate setting &amp;amp; audience, we were seated at tables with people from organisations of a similar size/area, encouraged to talk throughout the day between a single-track of interactive workshops and talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material throughout was genuinely brilliant, even if some was beyond what Iâ€™m doing today, and I walked away having learned a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.

Gosh itâ€™s been warm this week, and the pollen (in London, at least) has been going haywire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started taking antihistamines, which help but now thereâ€™s a whole host of other annoyances to contend with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway in news &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; unrelated to antihistamines resulting in unpredictable sleep, Iâ€™m writing this from Heathrow airport, sipping a breakfast of a Bloody Mary. The last real all-nighter I pulled was in 2019 to get to the same airport lounge, to catch the exact same flight. How weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s all good though, I got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of housework done and even drafted some future blog-posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Huge thank-you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/efinlay24&quot;&gt;Euan&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt; respectively for the tickets - I otherwise wouldn&apos;t have gone, which would have been a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt;â€™s name is definitely unintuitive: Iâ€™d recommend it to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; mid &amp;amp; senior level engineers as a flavour of what sorts of things tech-leads &amp;amp; engineering-managers are doing, as well as a guide on how to progress to either.  Itâ€™s also pointer to the wealth of excellent resources that now exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I last went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and at the time, as a recently-minted tech-lead, I found the content super-stretchy &amp;amp; valuable.  Several years later, some of the talks feel less relevant but I cannot understate how excellent &amp;amp; helpful it still was.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No running (yet) this week.  Itâ€™s the Platinum Jubilee so it was a short 3-day week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent some time reviewing fracture planes with a view to applying them to (hopefully) enable some several teams to work together in harmony.  Many things about this work are quite exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I went to a lunch with Fastly which was nice, not only because Fastly are a lovely collection of humans, but, because we learned about how other companies approach some of the same challenges that weâ€™re facing.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/dcc7d761-6e75-4cf3-9068-71989b3ec7cb?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Convalescing â€” 28th May]]></title><description><![CDATA[Week two of Covid: Last Saturday was the peak of my symptoms, and one long week later, I'm feeling somewhere between 93-96%.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every day &lt;a href=&quot;https://ouraring.com/&quot;&gt;Oura&lt;/a&gt; has reported a slightly healthier temperature, respiratory-rate &amp;amp; heart-rate-variability. The long-tail shows how gradual the recovery has been.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major symptoms were a dry-cough (which became a wet cough the next day), a five-day-long headache, fatigue (which hasn&apos;t gone entirely yet).  Oh, and sneezing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-sneezing&quot;&gt;which is how I know the vaccine is still doing something&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point I stopped being able to smell anything, which is a story involving food that I&apos;d really rather not go into.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/9c7263f6-3aea-4217-9b14-952468c41b53?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Succumbing â€” 21st May]]></title><description><![CDATA[Writing from my sofa in PJs: This week started out okay, and then I came down with Covid-19.

Somehow Iâ€™m trapped inside a rare virtuous cycle and reader - I am &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week I drew out two circuits: One short, through Putney Park Avenue, and the other, long, through Putney &amp;amp; Wimbledon Commons.  I skipped going to any Eurovision parties to give them a try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Iâ€™m most proud of is making sure thereâ€™s a good way of running at home, with other plans. This is a huge step which will make it a lot harder to procrastinate.  This is a good thing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After this second week of running, my legs still hurt. For some reason I started doing press-ups &amp;amp; planks again. Now the rest of me hurts too.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/a68da397-8a07-4cff-924e-4598db873970?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Reminiscing â€” 8th May 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[With Friday marking my birthday & several days off work, I went to Birmingham for the first time since last summer.

&lt;li&gt;With Friday marking my birthday &amp;amp; several days off work, I went to Birmingham for the first time since last summer. And walked, ate &amp;amp; drank a lot. And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/alexphotosthings/&quot;&gt;took some photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really nice seeing family in person &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/50d21458-ac67-4c16-ad05-a7111ff5001b&quot;&gt;after delaying in December&lt;/a&gt;, and finally exchanging Christmas gifts: My sister got me &lt;a href=&quot;https://digitalgametechnology.com/products/chess-clocks/dgt3000-fide-approved&quot;&gt;a chess timer&lt;/a&gt; which Iâ€™m thrilled about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With all the walking recently, I found my old running shoes &amp;amp; went on a few short runs: My legs hurt, but, in a good way. What hurts in a bad way is my ego: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7100960598&quot;&gt;Iâ€™m really down on my times from 2018&lt;/a&gt;, when I last did this. Hmm.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Thursday morning I thought &quot;Yolo&quot; and went into the office, and, surprisingly had a pretty decent â€” slightly productive â€” day.  For me, a denier of Thursdays, this is a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skipped cooking on Wednesday because, I accidentally took the last train. Whoops!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it&apos;s less pressure? Maybe it&apos;s novelty? Maybe it&apos;s a mixture of a healthier attitude: I did admin, formed a chonky proposal &amp;amp; wrote some code.  And felt great!&lt;/li&gt;
