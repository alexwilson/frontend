                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week marks &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/198b3ab3-2b8d-4da8-8881-1262d3eb2366&quot;&gt;a year since I left the FT&lt;/a&gt;, and my 51st week in Tokyo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is my head at a year after stepping away from journalism?  I still feel an incredible passion for the news and I miss it (and, of course, my beloved former coworkers) &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt; but I am also enjoying some distance from the cutting edge of current affairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve now got braces, sort-of, step-one of many, and getting ahead of future issues.  They are &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; limiting.  Pronouncing “Th” and “F” have become an adventure.  I’m sure you’d find it funny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a second batch of Pizza dough, this time with the same flour I previously used, and it went OK.  Still many variables to perfect.  Hydration was off, but the final bake was very good.  Future batches will be much smaller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BTW there is good Pizza in Tokyo. And sangria, and limoncello. Oh no.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How better to celebrate almost a year in Japan than to finally visit the Japanese equivalent of my hometown of Birmingham?  You may know it as Nagoya.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What took me to Nagoya…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/8fa394fb-c8f0-494e-8bc9-020d1ad0b63f?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcome to my 200th weeknote!  This week felt &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; long, but I don’t have all that much to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimentally I deleted all my social media apps, except for Instagram.  I’d already lowered engagement so this isn’t a huge change, but even scrolling passively was negatively affecting my mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First attempt in years at making pizza from scratch went well.  Better return-on-investment than pizzerias I’ve been to here, but between my dough not being &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; right and my oven not getting hot enough, there’s lots of variables to tune ~ which is a fun side-project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impromptu nominkai on Tuesday was very, very good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if Bertha, but good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my accounts was locked, and to fix it I had to send many emails and make one phone-call.  The phone-call involved iOS’s new live-translation feature, and I felt ashamed using it because the translation &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; English was not very good and didn’t convey any of my feeble attempts at keigo.  Good for emergencies, but I can&apos;t do that again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/48ba913e-2d6e-47b9-8e84-46300804e0d3?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has been a delicious and expensive week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of Terraform this week.  I mean &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt;.  Terraform is one of my favorite things in tech right now because it’s a single, simple declarative language for describing nearly everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazing Thai food for dinner on Monday in Ebisu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a few unexpected interesting conversations at work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking advantage of a few circumstances from recent weeks, I am going deep on self-improvement and have upgraded my 7-year-old Apple Watch, bought sweat-proof fitness earphones, procured more kitchen equipment - and finally - obtained a dining table. Phew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skipped papers club to go to a sauna for the first time in months.  My heat tolerance has dipped a lot, but that’s OK, I’ll get back there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have found the best Tacos in Tokyo.  It is a closely guarded secret so I can’t advertise it, but ask me and I will take you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In words never uttered by a human before: I had a fun dental appointment. And I’m going in for a much longer session later this…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new floor opened at work this week, bringing a few cool new things including an automatic coffee machine.  Our office is now twice as big as it was when I joined and I love finding interesting nooks for focus work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can only be described as the helicopter version of a motorcade flew of my office a few times this week.  It was the US state visit.  Strange thinking about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I re-did the AI agent stuff from the other week, and made it considerably simpler/better.  More extensible, if you will.  Now it outputs a pretty report and I&apos;m delighted with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the week I got some bad news.  It wasn’t unexpected, but it did still hurt.  But it’s in these moments when our real friends reveal themselves, and we christened a wonderful new bolt-hole I scouted (but hadn’t needed) inches away from my favouite photo-spot of Tokyo tower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a few extremely-basic-yet-coherent conversations in Japanese which was immensely rewarding.  I can’t have imagined being able to do this a year ago, but…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/ae8f6c8f-a97d-402d-b6a7-ce4066989682?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re in big coat season. The temperature is dropping and suddenly my wardrobe is significantly more stylish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got approval on my all-time biggest PR, huzzah!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of project meetings this week. It’s funny: things feel slow until suddenly they aren’t, and this always brings me a lot of energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese class was fun this week. I’m enjoying the speaking practice a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HUB, Donki and Jose Cuervo are currently doing a day-of-the-dead themed collaboration. One thing led to another and I was given their 1L watermelon cocktail. It was OK. I got a funny photo out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had some legendary biryani in Toranomon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samgyetang is unlike anything I’ve ever eaten. An entire chicken is added to a pot, and moments later it is transformed into something resembling a stew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned a lot about credit cards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday’s todo list had three items and I’m pleased to say that I checked off all three, including buying the milk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the upcoming US state visit, my neighborhood has a noticeably increased police…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a week, huh?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday was a bank holiday.  I wanted to find spicy soup and I’m pleased to say that I found some.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still recovering.  Each day I felt more myself, and each day returned some clarity which I hadn’t noticed I lost.  Unfortunately not in time for me to have potentially bungled something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At work I held a kick-off meeting which went OK, although my facilitation skills feel very rusty.  Gotta re-sharpen them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built an “AI Agent”. Can honestly say I’ve worked on nothing quite like this before - and the results are good - although integrating it into workflows is proving challenging: Sometimes I miss Bertha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had my second annual health check this week. It ran smoothly albeit long even if the phlebotomy left me feeling woozy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday the Yotsuya lxds drank orange wine and practiced zen buddhism.  I spelt my name right this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DPc7v_wiZje/&quot;&gt;“Ephemeral” at Such As&lt;/a&gt; which was a hybrid data-visualisation &amp;amp; art installation.  It charted bloom dates in Japan, and shows how changing…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hi, it’s me, I’ve been properly in the weeds of Google Docs and YAML.  Alas I will continue to primarily exist in these for a little while longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really liked this post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tk.gg/posts/ai-alt-text&quot;&gt;using AI to generate image captions&lt;/a&gt; by Matt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now that I’ve got the equipment I cooked at home a lot this week, which meant braving buying ingredients I didn’t 100% understand and re-learning how to cook without the luxury of counter-top space.  Never before have I missed owning a dishwasher as much as I do now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didn’t do much last week, which is why there’s no week 40.  What began as feeling run-down blossomed into full blown sickness.  By the time I saw my doctor I tested negative for everything, but whatever this was took a serious toll on my energy levels, mood and focus and I’m still recovering bit-by-bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That meant staying in and playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegamesdb.net/game.php?id=85013&quot;&gt;The Great Ace Attorney&lt;/a&gt; which is cheesy as all hell and goes hard on stereotyping England.  Doubling-down, I watched some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005363/&quot;&gt;Guy Ritchie&lt;/a&gt; movies: It &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t a good week…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three-day work week this week.  I begin in Osaka, following my defeat (or victory?) at the Queueing Olympics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originally my plan is to be back in Tokyo quite early, but I cancel my plans on Tuesday to instead spend the day pottering about Osaka and looking at and eating things.  The city has a very different atmosphere which I love.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This also includes possibly the most unhealthy Tonkatsu lunch I will ever eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spend some time over the week iterating on a design-document and corresponding schema, which involves going back to the drawing board a few times.  The combination of short week and many iterations means I make less net progress than I’d hoped to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New 5K PB is a nice small win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the context of journalism, I learn a fair bit about financial reporting obligations in Japan, which for a place with so much paperwork turn out to be surprisingly difficult.  Or maybe I’m too used to Company House?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m introduced to a new spot which I’m afraid I have to gatekeep because I will be…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two big themes of this week are: Kafka and the 2025 World Expo.  Both have been prompted much thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kafka is a technology I’ve used indirectly a lot over the years. A deep dive this week helped me understand it better, and so I’ve been reimagining how some big systems might work if built on Kafka with Event Sourcing, which has been very exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big dinner during the week turns out to be a big miss, which is a good thing because it reminds me just how good the service and food is in most places.  Important not to take anything for granted!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday night karaoke is pretty good.  We start at dinner and end up in a booth where I discover Pendulum is on the docket and that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to do Karaoke to Drum ‘n Bass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My subsequent adventure to find hard techno starts on a high note: I meet interesting people and have eclectic conversations.  But one interaction brings me vividly back to a night in Germany, which raises the question: Is this still fun?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the week I also go on…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/904396c1-32e8-4cd6-a491-1afa98b74b34?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was a good week?  22.53km of running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of this week went into a messy incident and data-recovery operation.  I’m actively thinking about architectural interventions to prevent scenarios exactly like this one, so this was very timely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With my plate clearer, I had an uninterrupted day to work on strategy, and made good progress.  The hardest part is always starting, so I’ve begun with Will Larson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://lethain.com/good-engineering-strategy-is-boring/&quot;&gt;“Write five, then synthesize”&lt;/a&gt; approach which is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; JFDI-minded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One afternoon, instead of lunch, on the way to the office I make a pit-stop in Toranomon Hills for a long-anticipated coffee where I learn a lot about fin-tech, a lot about founding a company in Japan and also get a great pep-talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amongst serious songs, at karaoke I do &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4&quot;&gt;the He-Man duet of “What&apos;s Up?”&lt;/a&gt; with DS.  Later I pray that the only recording of this moment is the one now forever etched into my brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After two false starts - which involve walking to okubo and helping set up a bunch of accounts - Friday night we…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/8a12f155-bdf5-4b5e-9d92-7ee4ad0f0513?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;
