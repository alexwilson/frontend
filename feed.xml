                  &lt;p&gt;S﻿lack&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/productivity/a-redesigned-slack-built-for-focus&quot;&gt;new UI&lt;/a&gt; hits pretty different.﻿ Since it&apos;s rolling out &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt;, being in multiple organisations is quite jarring as it impacts organisation-switching the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it&apos;s still possible to opt-in, or opt-out, on a per-organisation basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enable Developer mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I﻿f you haven&apos;t already, enable developer mode by setting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O﻿n macOS or Linux, this could mean adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU=true&lt;/code&gt; in your profile, and then restarting Slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for macOS &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;, running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;launchctl setenv SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU true&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal will work until you log-out of your Mac, or switch it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Windows environments, if you&apos;re uncomfortable with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html&quot;&gt;setting environment variables&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/955dro/how_do_i_open_the_chromium_developer_tools_in_the/&quot;&gt;something like this will work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N﻿ext, open the inspector. It &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; now appear under &quot;View&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Developer&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Toggle DevTools&quot;.  Or if you&apos;re used to a Google-Chrome-like browser, do whatever you normally do to open the inspector (Cmd+Shift+I on a Mac).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;T﻿o enable the new UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the inspector, and execute this code in the console:
&lt;em&gt;(Or, have a read…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlights this week include watching the outcomes of a design-sprint, validating the core technical idea in my new project and watching someone implement image transformation with matrices by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is my hundredth weeknote, and I&apos;m nearly the point where these outnumber my other posts 10:1.  I&apos;ll probably change how the RSS feed works or something to celebrate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September&apos;s scorching weather is brutal.  Much like has happened with the Central line, an entire summer&apos;s worth of heat has built-up in my building, meaning that when I get home I&apos;m greeted by warm water from my cold taps and that my portable air conditioner has met its match.  Avg. 29C, Max 34C, Min 26C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So: I&apos;m pretty deep in the rabbit-hole of JavaScript bundling formats right now, but it&apos;s OK - it&apos;s for a good cause: micro-frontends.  One challenge that we will face is interoperability between ES modules and our current chosen polyfill format: SystemJS.  I enjoy these rabbit-holes, but much less than I used to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/5c0d4a64-54c6-4425-9e2d-a5e57f6b4526?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was a short one.  I spent Monday morning sitting in a cafe finishing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilecommshandbook.com/&quot;&gt;Agile Comms Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, my honest takeaway is that it&apos;s great.  At the start there&apos;s a core premise of how to structure comms, then the remainder is a mixture of guidance and practical steps to make it work.  All the talk of tea made me regret the coffee I paired it with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&apos;re done with our first round of planning sessions to enable micro-frontends, or extensions!  There are several components that bring it together, and we&apos;ve scoped just enough of all of them to enable an end-to-end basic demo relatively soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sagemaker is behaving now.  &lt;em&gt;Sort-of&lt;/em&gt;.  We succeeded to do some training on satellite photographs, but it&apos;s still missing some of our hyperparameters so we can&apos;t tune much.  They should be in a file, or in an environment variable, but they&apos;re appearing in neither.  So there&apos;s a light sprinkling of hardcoding happening until we sort that out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also starting to get my head around the elections next…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6fa8589e-5891-47e7-a9f0-207b56149da0?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week marked the first few planning sessions to enable micro-frontends, or extensions.  I&apos;ve been using the story mapping format to walk through end-to-end journeys and draw up epics and tickets.  We got quite far, and we&apos;re on the cusp of starting to drive a few standards.  I love wearing this hat in projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also published a blog post about that work and generally the reception has been really nice.  I worry that I went too in-depth with the technical details, and now reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilecommshandbook.com/&quot;&gt;Agile Comms Handbook&lt;/a&gt; I&apos;m considering how to better brand this work - both to describe the short-term (which is intentionally small!) and the promise of the long-term.  The balance is off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sagemaker is such a headache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summer is a funny time of year: They say that things slow down, but &lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt; that they speed up.  Those going away on holiday want to see things happen while they&apos;re away.  Those coming back from holiday want to see things happen now that they&apos;re back.  One of these years I&apos;ll become one of these smart, smart people - take &lt;em&gt;holidays&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f27fe5f-243f-4b65-8e14-c8236ec36914?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&apos;s big theme at work was architecture and planning for Extensible Frontends: I&apos;ve arrived at what seems like a reasonable proposal.  I&apos;ve pared back the scope to just enabling deployments, and am trying to be as unopinionated as possible about what is actually deployed, because research has proven that opinions are a big ongoing investment.  In the coming weeks the new team (which also gathered for the first time this week) breaks ground, but we need to better socialise this first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elections are now also officially kicked-off.  Lots to do, not much time to do it in.  Busy, busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately this week&apos;s efforts in machine-learning land were not that successful: The good news is that models are running, the bad news is that in AWS-land it&apos;s pretty boilerplate-intensive to train (or fine-tune) a model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One fun distraction, was stumbling upon a critical security vulnerability affecting several of my older projects and I got in touch with my old teams to help them mitigate the…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/cfd56234-9e54-4487-b917-aef18c059537?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working at the FT for a long time, finally this week I made a change to the homepage.  And then I made another one.  Both worked out fine, although they&apos;re small so you won&apos;t see anything.  Smol milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lxds I did it, I&apos;ve got a Splunk dashboard named after me.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6dcc00c2-ac66-4569-b76b-e17c3114c264&quot;&gt;Remember the hackathon?&lt;/a&gt;  Turns out I was sending a large number of requests.  Probably because my Google Script add-on implemented retries, and I was sending at least 200 individual requests, therefore maybe accidentally doing a denial-of-service against our internal LLM.  Whoops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also spent a bit of time this week supporting my team in editorial with adopting notebooks via SageMaker.  It&apos;s off to a rocky start so far, but it&apos;s mostly AWS related challenges - permissions and images and such.  I really wish AWS was significantly more user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I spent a couple of hours on a 10%-time project that I&apos;ve been excited about for a while, which is restoring some of the digital signage I worked on several years ago.  Mostly spent the time scaffolding out a new project (porting from PHP to Node) and exploring data.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/dc634371-4475-4ee5-ae66-737911dc04da?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlight of this week was prepping and giving a presentation to kick-off some work I&apos;ve been doing since June, the thing I&apos;ve referred to as the &quot;product coexistence&quot; problem, or as we&apos;ve been calling it, &quot;extensible frontends&quot;.  The main thing I wanted to get from the kick-off was getting alignment, and I think we did it.  Also I designed a timeline chart which I&apos;m weirdly proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mid-year review was on Wednesday.  On the whole, really nice feedback.  Some feedback came up about how I do (or seem to do) too much, which I need to ponder a bit: My strategy has been having no more than 3 big things in-flight at a time (they tend to run on, so, you know) - and &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I may have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/prioritising-in-tech-leadership.html#rocks-pebbles-and-sand-to-focus-our-time&quot;&gt;Rocks, Pebbles and Sand problem&lt;/a&gt;.  I think she&apos;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdest thing I did this week was find and buy a single Macbook key.  The minus key.  A few months ago I damaged one of the keys, and it has slowly come loose.  I managed to find one online and after swapping out the assembly my keyboard is as good as new.  &lt;em&gt;(Screen still needs a clean!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/d1d03567-affa-4737-833d-b2b03106a334?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week marked the FT&apos;s first hackday in two years.  The theme was AI and we had just over a day to try and build something interesting.  It was loads of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My team of EH, AC, OO, FS and I started out by trying to generate video accompaniments to articles - but after realising that the videos were rather long, we pivoted towards video shorts (think: tiktok).  To enable our hack, I wrote a cursed integration between google sheets and our internal LLM.  We managed to create a few videos but it&apos;s nowhere near ready for prime-time: we didn&apos;t win, but we did get a few laughs and a shout-out from the judges!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some teams built some really cool stuff!  Including a novel chat based UI for interacting with the site (one that actually seemed quite fresh) and a Nikkei team built a tool for geolocation for use in investigative journalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday marked Arjun&apos;s birthday and for lack of rain we went on a mission to infiltrate another drinks: In the end we were invited and so the mission failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the theme of Machine-Learning, I picked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.credly.com/badges/0bc35463-7478-4b67-88b3-0060d78feee8&quot;&gt;IBM&apos;s AI Engineering certification&lt;/a&gt; back up (having paused it in 2020) and finished the whole thing over the weekend.  Lots of repeated content, but also…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6dcc00c2-ac66-4569-b76b-e17c3114c264?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another busy week, week 2 of midterms.  But they&apos;re over now, &lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Monday, in part to celebrate handing in my first two midterm assignments, and in part because I&apos;d already made these plans, I went to see the new Mission Impossible movie with AD and CR.  It was good!  Lots of build, especially in the run-up to Part 2.  I couldn&apos;t stop noticing that in every shot Tom Cruise managed to make himself look so tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent a lot of time this week talking to people about how to staff an upcoming technical strategy initiative.  And then the rest doing the first of a few interviews with people who worked on similar projects in the past, where I learned loads.  A major theme was finding novel ways to remove the felt constraints of our organisational structure - moving past &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law&quot;&gt;Conway&apos;s law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/rolling-out-cms-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Spark team&lt;/a&gt; ran a hack-week this week, and I joined their presentation on Friday to see some of the results.  All great stuff, but my favourites were an experimental implementation of push-notifications…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/5ede8da6-7556-4e74-bd8c-ce5c9de3bbad?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busy week. No video-games for Alex this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarised a few months of design-work into a technical-design-doc this week, and circulated it around to get a bunch of feedback.  It speaks to including code in FT articles, in a similar way to something I&apos;m considering doing on this blog.  Very excited about this work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had my first 1:1 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; this week which was great. Given that it was one of the first meetings in her new role, it prompted me to write what I&apos;m calling reverse-manager-README: It&apos;s an experimental document inspired by a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickramsbottom.com&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; about how bringing context about the quirks of managing you would be nice for managers. I&apos;ve never written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://svnk.github.io/manager-READMEs&quot;&gt;manager-readme&lt;/a&gt; because they seem a bit impersonal, but this exercise has given me second thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening I went to a Nikkei dinner with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukeblaney.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt; and JK at a steakhouse where - after talking about how it&apos;s a long-term aspiration - I was floored by someone asking me &quot;What&apos;s your strategy to move to Japan?&quot;.  I hope I handled it well!  For now I am only focusing on language.  We talked a little bit about cyber-attacks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043-this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends&quot;&gt;This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends&lt;/a&gt; came up — an absolutely phenomenal read.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
