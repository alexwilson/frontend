                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Zeno&apos;s paradox of &lt;a href=&quot;https://personal.lse.ac.uk/robert49/ebooks/philsciadventures/lecture24.html&quot;&gt;Achilles and the Tortoise&lt;/a&gt;, it&apos;s impossible for Achilles to catch-up with the Tortoise because the Tortoise is always ⅒ of the distance ahead of Achilles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes perfect sense because there&apos;ll always be an infinitesimally small distance between them, however, &lt;em&gt;unfortunately&lt;/em&gt; in reality the laws of physics exist and also we don&apos;t live inside a maths puzzle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting back at work this week, a week after everyone else, in many ways I felt like Achilles — not only because I could not catch-up with everyone else&apos;s head-start — but also because I hurt my foot and I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s what he was famous for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I have caught up now, though, at least enough to have found this silly metaphor for the second week of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New year, new calendar: I am trying out time-blocking (the old fashioned way, without any fancy apps) to focus on specific tasks.  Specifically taking some time and saying, &quot;OK NOW WE WILL FOCUS ON X&quot; is just intrinsically motivating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoyed watching…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/8dc5fbfe-cf65-4a16-9b2b-4e50eb07cbd9?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New year, new feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We welcome the new year outside surrounded by a cacophony of fireworks.  It&apos;s freezing, but despite the temperature it doesn&apos;t feel cold.  Maybe it was the dancing.  Another sip of champagne.  Rick Astley begins singing on the TV inside.  This time feels different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Year&apos;s Day falling on a Monday stretched out my holiday break to include the entire first week of the year, a first - excuse the pun, which gave me some time to catch-up with people and with my reading list.  Is 40 books doable this year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGxIE1hr0w4&quot;&gt;rickrolled&lt;/a&gt; us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week also brought coursework, so much of it that some of my upcoming evenings will continue to be consigned to it.  Sigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proud of my sister.  Really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amidst other reads I binged &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62296528-spare&quot;&gt;Prince Harry&apos;s book, Spare&lt;/a&gt; — and I&apos;m not sure what to make of it.  It casts the British monarchy through a very human lens, making them seem far more relatable than we normally see.  And yet something felt very off: I feel like I learned something, but, I don&apos;t…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/103d58cf-60ca-499e-b83c-43504ac5a667?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since pausing writing on holiday I hadn&apos;t made any time to write, but we&apos;re so back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are now four weeks left until the year is done.  Think about that for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achievements this week included setting a new Rubik&apos;s cube PB of 0.75 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the end-of-the-year review cycle coming, much of my time this week has been spent on management tasks which I&apos;m enjoying quite a bit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362722&quot;&gt;Across the Spider-Verse&lt;/a&gt; was a beautiful film to watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a rather nice dinner with some visitors at a Sichuan restaurant, where I was introduced to the combo of Mapo Tofu and Chicken Fried Rice.  It shouldn&apos;t work, but it really, really does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20245360&quot;&gt;New Doctor Who&lt;/a&gt; is so much better than I thought it would be.  Other than (probably deliberately) provoking some discourse, it feels like exactly what I grew up with.  Not to be taken too seriously, of course.  Lots of fun.  Thanks for coming back RTD!  Now let&apos;s just forget all of season 13.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep getting invites to external events, and I&apos;m only recently…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/7430bc12-9179-41e4-a831-0db583168718?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally on holiday!  Writing this from the tiny desk in my tiny hotel room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked Monday, Tuesday &amp;amp; Wednesday which were quite intense but then went by very quickly.  Monday and Wednesday I crammed in a lot of and writing to ensure all the things would keep going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday was my team&apos;s (group tech leadership) first away day since I joined.  We met at a vendor office in Shoreditch to retrospect over the year and examine topics including our technology strategy in more depth than we usually can.  We don&apos;t spend much time together as a team, so on top of the day itself I enjoyed having a natter.  We closed with 2 Truths &amp;amp; 1 Lie and I managed to fool the room which, you know, I&apos;m not sure what that says about me but there we go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A perfect storm of the right conditions set me up to enjoy the worst case of jet-lag I&apos;ve ever had: I barely slept Tuesday and Wednesday night (nerves, and, an early start).  Early Finnair flight was lovely and the airport lounge in Helsinki was even lovelier…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/98b62001-a95d-4275-b594-2ea66c4f2f4a?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four weeknotes in one.  They were written, but my publishing pipeline was stuck.  I&apos;ve fixed it now!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 40 - is this week!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/71d36738-255e-49d8-af43-4ade14535c64&quot;&gt;Week 39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b0acee94-5aa7-4589-9098-be86832825fe&quot;&gt;Week 38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/46dcc1c2-4791-4410-9065-e63318554381&quot;&gt;Week 37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Major theme of this week has been cramming before my holiday: Which has meant cranking through the chores I need to finish, trying to set many things in motion at work, reaching out to people to catch-up and a surprising amount of last-minute shopping.  I now own another pair of trainers, but between discounts and clever accounting on my part these were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv0o-nQtFth&quot;&gt;basically free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent oodles and oodles of time digging through JavaScript module behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After feeling very rotten over the weekend and Monday, I spent the entire week working from home.  In part, just in case I was contagious, and in part because I don&apos;t want to catch anything before flying next week.  I don&apos;t think I could be remote full-time: Video-calls are much more draining &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt; with a really nice set-up — but my main issue is a lack of self-discipline around stopping the…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/40b556c0-f12c-4d48-a676-89908eb8218b?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OKRs and micro-frontends this week, mostly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met with all my teams to review their OKRs, and then later met with all the teams that IG Integration relies upon to discuss what they&apos;re able to do in Q4 - and how it jives with their OKRs.  Starting to feel like I might know what I&apos;m doing?  Very scary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent a very long time debugging how our micro-frontend module-loader performs in different browser environments, including a few pairing sessions.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end I rewrote our loading mechanism to be entirely event-based and to better align it to the browser lifecycle.  So now, as soon as JS can run, we:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;begin fetching modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we allow them to bootstrap as soon as page information is available (but before the DOM exists)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lastly we queue all of them up until the DOM is ready for components to begin interacting with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was a probably the most in-depth frontend activity I&apos;ve done in a while, and it was nice to know that my skills are still sharp, it wasn&apos;t as thrilling as I used to find this stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/71d36738-255e-49d8-af43-4ade14535c64?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my teams, Storytelling, ran a nice away-day - where everyone made it into London.  I wasn&apos;t at the main event itself, but I was there for both dinners and a lunch (hopefully not only invited so I would pay...).  But I had a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; time talking to people I don&apos;t normally get a chance to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Tuesday I had my last occupational health session at work, where I got a simple question, &quot;Are you feeling like yourself again?&quot; - and for the first time all year, the answer was a resounding yes.  I&apos;ve been in a bit of a rut, and have felt anxious and stuck, but that&apos;s all over now — and I have the all-clear to start working out and travelling again, so I should probably take advantage of it.  Writing this particular point entirely for myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sure why but I found this week particularly tiring.  I had a moment at the end of it, with George, where we just sat there in silence.  &quot;I&apos;m exhausted&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also met up for dinner with Hajime, who was in town for a big data conference.  Dinner was…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;S﻿lack&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/productivity/a-redesigned-slack-built-for-focus&quot;&gt;new UI&lt;/a&gt; hits pretty different.﻿ Since it&apos;s rolling out &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt;, being in multiple organisations is quite jarring as it impacts organisation-switching the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it&apos;s still possible to opt-in, or opt-out, on a per-organisation basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enable Developer mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I﻿f you haven&apos;t already, enable developer mode by setting the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O﻿n macOS or Linux, this could mean adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU=true&lt;/code&gt; in your profile, and then restarting Slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for macOS &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt;, running &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;launchctl setenv SLACK_DEVELOPER_MENU true&lt;/code&gt; in a terminal will work until you log-out of your Mac, or switch it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Windows environments, if you&apos;re uncomfortable with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html&quot;&gt;setting environment variables&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/955dro/how_do_i_open_the_chromium_developer_tools_in_the/&quot;&gt;something like this will work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N﻿ext, open the inspector. It &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; now appear under &quot;View&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Developer&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Toggle DevTools&quot;.  Or if you&apos;re used to a Google-Chrome-like browser, do whatever you normally do to open the inspector (Cmd+Shift+I on a Mac).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;T﻿o enable the new UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the inspector, and execute this code in the console:
&lt;em&gt;(Or, have a read…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&apos;re into the final planning cycle of the year, which is a particularly interesting one because it&apos;s also the planning cycle that feeds into next years&apos; budgets.  So, busy days ahead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a scare, I ended up doing a piece of data analysis which involved both of our content APIs, and producing a differential of the data in each.  I used Jupyter and Pandas, the actual disunion was a one-liner: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;only_in_api1_df = api1_df.loc[~api1_df[&apos;uuid&apos;].isin(api2_df[&apos;id&apos;])]&lt;/code&gt;, and the hardest part (and yes, I&apos;m including fetching the data in the first place) was reading files off of Google Drive!  PyDrive, which is what Google recommend, is abandonware!  Anyway, crisis averted: the report confirmed our suspicion that there was no difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got invited to a leaving drinks which morphed into editorial drinks, which was intense but very interesting - and I walked back having met a lot of people I&apos;d only ever heard of or emailed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After some advice from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thoughtsoflj&quot;&gt;a sage&lt;/a&gt; I made it my mission this week to name some projects.  So first, the work to introduce a native graphics…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlights this week include watching the outcomes of a design-sprint, validating the core technical idea in my new project and watching someone implement image transformation with matrices by hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is my hundredth weeknote, and I&apos;m nearly the point where these outnumber my other posts 10:1.  I&apos;ll probably change how the RSS feed works or something to celebrate!&lt;/li&gt;
