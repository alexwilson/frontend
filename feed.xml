Winter was wonderful and the heating stayed off, but, now Iâ€™m craving the cool touch of air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current life-hacks involve shorts and bootleg iced-coffees, which is to say refrigerated milk and whatever form of concentrated caffeine I can find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a time to begin reading John Doerr&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://speedandscale.com/&quot;&gt;Speed &amp;amp; Scale&lt;/a&gt;. From an author known for OKRs, itâ€™s a book with case studies and an action plan for tackling climate change. The website includes much of the same information and &lt;a href=&quot;https://speedandscale.com/tracker/&quot;&gt;an interactive tracker for each objective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy to stop eating beef, but itâ€™s slightly disheartening to see that many big objectives are off-target: Perhaps the heat will stop us bickering and supporting populists? Oneâ€¦&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/ba074770-eea7-429f-9fe2-36c19df392d7?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Revising â€” 10th July 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week I was preoccupied with SGDQ so didnâ€™t write anything â€” this week was genuinely exhausting in a nice way.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SGDQ was tonnes of fun, and in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNbkv_DJ0f0&quot;&gt;Ocarina of Time: Triforce%&lt;/a&gt; is one of the genuinely coolest things Iâ€™ve ever seen. Also after contributing for years, for the first time one of my donations got announced out in front of 100k people: It felt &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the work week, the recently formed API Rationalisation team ran a in-person office-hours where they talked about their current thinking. Really cool, not only because itâ€™s similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/d1a4a7bb-fc4d-41f2-8482-8a7afe1af0e6&quot;&gt;approach we took in FT Specialist&lt;/a&gt;â€¦&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f9856e3-eef0-47c1-970b-9dc1dbaa6252?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Immersing â€” 26th June 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[This week was my first time back to Sofia since repatriating and after relearning the art of crossing roads, it was brilliant seeing how well my old team are doing, catching up with friends and making some new ones.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, in the heat I walked around the entire city through every park â€” including some I hadnâ€™t visited while out there. South Park is lovely!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between catching-up &amp;amp; work, I also did a midterm exercise on Algorithms: The hardest part was revising pseudocode! ðŸ˜…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately though not all was good, and politics came to a head resulting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/bulgarian-government-faces-no-confidence-vote-political-turmoil-2022-06-22/&quot;&gt;government shutdown&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the US supreme court, in a heartbreaking regression to human rights, has put many in medical peril. RMT in the UK are also fighting for workers rights. Thereâ€™s a strange energy in the air right now.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/3e44c675-e425-4af4-953d-2c2ed4315b27?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to be a CTO: Lessons from LeadingEng 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently I was lucky enough to attend LeadingEng London, hereâ€™s what I learned.

&lt;p&gt;With a more intimate setting &amp;amp; audience, we were seated at tables with people from organisations of a similar size/area, encouraged to talk throughout the day between a single-track of interactive workshops and talks.&lt;/p&gt;

Gosh itâ€™s been warm this week, and the pollen (in London, at least) has been going haywire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started taking antihistamines, which help but now thereâ€™s a whole host of other annoyances to contend with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway in news &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; unrelated to antihistamines resulting in unpredictable sleep, Iâ€™m writing this from Heathrow airport, sipping a breakfast of a Bloody Mary. The last real all-nighter I pulled was in 2019 to get to the same airport lounge, to catch the exact same flight. How weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Itâ€™s all good though, I got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of housework done and even drafted some future blog-posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the FTâ€™s Japanese culture club invited in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urasenke.co.uk/about-us.html&quot;&gt;Urasenke&lt;/a&gt;â€¦&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/e7bac4da-1779-4d38-842f-85e4673dfc47?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Archaeologising â€” 12th June 2022]]></title><description><![CDATA[During the week I was lucky enough to go to both LeadDev & LeadingEng conferences.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt;â€™s name is definitely unintuitive: Iâ€™d recommend it to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; mid &amp;amp; senior level engineers as a flavour of what sorts of things tech-leads &amp;amp; engineering-managers are doing, as well as a guide on how to progress to either.  Itâ€™s also pointer to the wealth of excellent resources that now exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I last went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and at the time, as a recently-minted tech-lead, I found the content super-stretchy &amp;amp; valuable.  Several years later, some of the talks feel less relevant but I cannot understate how excellent &amp;amp; helpful it still was.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No running (yet) this week.  Itâ€™s the Platinum Jubilee so it was a short 3-day week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent some time reviewing fracture planes with a view to applying them to (hopefully) enable some several teams to work together in harmony.  Many things about this work are quite exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I went to a lunch with Fastly which was nice, not only because Fastly are a lovely collection of humans, but, because we learned about how other companies approach some of the same challenges that weâ€™re facing.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/dcc7d761-6e75-4cf3-9068-71989b3ec7cb?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weeknotes: Convalescing â€” 28th May]]></title><description><![CDATA[Week two of Covid: Last Saturday was the peak of my symptoms, and one long week later, I'm feeling somewhere between 93-96%.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every day &lt;a href=&quot;https://ouraring.com/&quot;&gt;Oura&lt;/a&gt; has reported a slightly healthier temperature, respiratory-rate &amp;amp; heart-rate-variability. The long-tail shows how gradual the recovery has been.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major symptoms were a dry-cough (which became a wet cough the next day), a five-day-long headache, fatigue (which hasn&apos;t gone entirely yet).  Oh, and sneezing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-sneezing&quot;&gt;which is how I know the vaccine is still doing something&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Somehow Iâ€™m trapped inside a rare virtuous cycle and reader - I am &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week I drew out two circuits: One short, through Putney Park Avenue, and the other, long, through Putney &amp;amp; Wimbledon Commons.  I skipped going to any Eurovision parties to give them a try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Iâ€™m most proud of is making sure thereâ€™s a good way of running at home, with other plans. This is a huge step which will make it a lot harder to procrastinate.  This is a good thing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After this second week of running, my legs still hurt. For some reason I started doing press-ups &amp;amp; planks again. Now the rest of me hurts too.&lt;/li&gt;â€¦&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/a68da397-8a07-4cff-924e-4598db873970?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
