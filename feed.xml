                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week’s story is best told through its dinners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday we find ourselves at The Indian Brewery.  We order two naans and a side of fish.  This is pit-stop on the way to cocktails after a few hours in the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday ends at Birmingham’s most notorious institution: Maccies on the Ramp.  We have a tradition, born in darker days, which always finds us either here or Temple Row.  We meet near Ikon and take the long way round discussing startups and runners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday’s dinner is a humble Meal Deal: It’s a cost-effective way of powering our mini-celebration of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/48991574&quot;&gt;St Swithin’s day&lt;/a&gt;. There’s two excellent coffees - I haven’t had espresso drinks in a hot minute so these keep me up into the wee hours.  The night ends with me extolling the virtues of powdered jasmine tea - which is perfectly proportioned to blend with a pint of iced water.  Then I go for a (very) long walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday is a killer serving of Falafel &amp;amp; Halloumi with a side of Ayran.  It caps AN’s leaving drinks - which are…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/a118ee8a-9154-4390-b43d-9c44720df964?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week feels like a count-down, but, even as I close the week I’m unsure what it was counting down &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did some writing about strategy and gave a small presso about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/&quot;&gt;Golden Signals&lt;/a&gt;.  The Golden Signals are a great example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://strategyu.co/wtf-is-mece-mutually-exclusive-collectively-exhaustive/&quot;&gt;Mutually-Exclusive, Collectively-Exhaustive&lt;/a&gt; framework thinking in the wild: As metrics they don’t overlap but they still let you clearly pinpoint if something is working, how well, etc.  This is the point I want to eventually land: At a high level they&apos;re enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I woke up absolutely ready to fight the world. I channelled that energy into writing a 900 line pull request, and in doing so I reminded myself that I’m not bad at this whole software development thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Thursday I yeet a message which I immediately regret.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After weeks of pitching drinks in the sun the day has finally arrived.  And after weeks of beautiful weather, it’s the heaviest sudden rainfall Tokyo has seen in quite some time.  We pivot to indoors and take turns trying to take…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/23755f8c-602a-47b2-a31e-265b6f0fc150?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuelled by the introspection and retrospection of the last two weeks, I felt an enjoyable clarity all week. Unfortunately, at the same time, the weather did its darndest to punish me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in data:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running: 158 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italian food eaten: 2 pizzas, 1 pasta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike parking: Free for First 2 Hourse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capability mapping is going well.  It’ll require a few passes to get right so I’m publishing early &amp;amp; often: Inaccuracies open a feedback loop for both improving the mapping, and, for finding areas for future improvements.  I&apos;m starting to understand how governance can work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers Club reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction&quot;&gt;MCP&lt;/a&gt; this week.  What I like is that there aren’t any new fundamental ideas: You aggregate APIs.  What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; new: A new class of security vulnerability.  There’s lots of room for interesting development there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a first-pass at setting both my objectives and my expectations for the rest of the year.  It means doing a lot of (realistic) thinking about further developing as an IC, which is exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reconnected with some old coworkers in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1310/A131002/13214764/&quot;&gt;the best English-style pub I’ve been to yet&lt;/a&gt; - which was an absolute blast - with a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/ed088553-8ca5-4c2a-8a71-e9f3d3f26f53?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This has been a Fusion heavy week: I have been virtually reliving the Sonnendeck, Tanzwüste &amp;amp; Turnbühne whilst gazing at all the stories from Glasto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started something exciting: Capability Mapping.  There are a lot of APIs in my new jurisdiction, and to deliver the best possible platform experience, we first need a map of what they do and what they don’t.  I’m the Ordinance Survey in this situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivated by this I am experiencing severe Biz-Ops withdrawal: I want to model everything - in work and in life - in graphs.  No.  I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to model everything - in work and in life - in graphs.  Just one more node.  That’s all I need.  I can stop any time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to my notes, “Got some stuff into production”, so, that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the week and weekend, I went through a series of McKinsey courses on topics ranging from resilience, communication and problem-solving*.  Some of the content was basic, but for every topic there was at least one practical tool, framework or technique.  There were lots…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/82bd3ca5-74b6-4f2b-a680-31690375eb77?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader, this week - in an entirely positive way - was rather a lot. It was cyclical. It had highs and lows. And I unlocked some unactualised-but-latent personal growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in data:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance walked: 112,780 steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversations: 14 phone-calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jitter: 10ms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internet saga has concluded: For reasons unclear to anyone, I’m on a VDSL line which runs parallel to the gigabit ethernet already in my building. It doesn’t matter much since the central switch is still capped.  But it’s enough: I can now finally take video-calls at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The week begins with two high stakes conversations. For both, I believed that I was not equipped, so I assembled a brain trust.  And reader, the brain trust &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; came through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both conversations are call-backs to previous conversations from my past, and despite being &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; thematically unrelated, I have tactlessly avoided both for the longest time.  But this week I saw the avoidant link, and decided to change that.  Equipped with advice, second…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/9653be3b-20fd-467c-a493-840cea6370e4?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to say.  Stats are looking good this week.  Packed quite a lot in.  Tapped into some positive energy.  Wrote 0 Golang.   Wrote lots of words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in data:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers Read: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palace Run: -9 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chess Ranking: +3 ELO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;今ちょっと暑いね？　うちのエアコンは頑張ってるよ！&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of recruitment activities this week, including I think the greater number of interviews done in a week in a hot minute.  (the 2019 record is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; impossible to beat though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JS community said it couldn’t be done, but in a tiny technical win, I figured out how to feature-flag something gnarly this week. (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/97c9a70f-3d45-4d96-94dd-3071f6af2dcd&quot;&gt;Maybe still technical?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marking &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt; a year since it started, Papers Club finished our longest paper yet, completing our deep-dive into Mixture of Experts architecture.  In our year we’ve welcomed guests, new members and new structure and I’ve learned lots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move over &lt;a href=&quot;https://jisho.org/word/%E5%BE%AE%E5%A6%99&quot;&gt;微妙&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://jisho.org/word/%E6%88%90%E7%A8%8B&quot;&gt;成る程&lt;/a&gt;, my new favourite word is &lt;a href=&quot;https://jisho.org/word/%E7%A2%BA%E3%81%8B%E3%81%AB&quot;&gt;確かに&lt;/a&gt; and it’s ENDLESSLY applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have resumed running &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of the gym, and so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/14792322238/overview&quot;&gt;attempted Palace Run again&lt;/a&gt;.  Last time…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few puzzle-pieces slotted into place this week.  People have noticed my use of the word なるほど.  Closed a meeting at work with &lt;em&gt;頑張っていきましょう！&lt;/em&gt; to some smiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in data:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voxpops dodged: 3 reporters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creepy-crawlies spotted: 7 large bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regrets: 1 big mistake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re still working on the “How does Alex get home internet?” saga. This isn’t so high priority, because, you know, unlimited 5G. But it’s become clear this is more of a saga than an check-list item.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MT bullied me into sending a message.  A good friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After putting public speaking off for ages (other than a &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/06fd4e46-dd48-4650-90aa-ec4ecde32479&quot;&gt;brief self-introduction&lt;/a&gt;, and right before that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/198b3ab3-2b8d-4da8-8881-1262d3eb2366&quot;&gt;my leaving speech&lt;/a&gt;), I gave a progress update at an all-hands.  It went well, and it felt easy even, and I left it feeling unfazed.  Whatever has made me overthink public speaking recently, I seem to be getting over it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workload has climbed, &lt;em&gt;ever-so-slightly&lt;/em&gt;, this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I talk about how &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mori.art.museum/en/exhibitions/machine_love/&quot;&gt;Machine Love&lt;/a&gt; was?  It was an exhibition at the Mori Art Museum on perhaps my favourite topic: In a cybernetic wold, what does it mean to be human?  I loved it all.  Three particular standouts were &lt;a href=&quot;http://ayoungkim.com/wp/3col/delivery-dancers-sphere-2022&quot;&gt;Delivery Dancer’s Sphere&lt;/a&gt; by Kim Ayoung (unfortunately not available online), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.calculatingempires.com/&quot;&gt;Calculating Empires&lt;/a&gt; by Kate Crawford &amp;amp; Vladan Joler, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://luyang.asia/2023/05/20/doku-the-self/&quot;&gt;DOKU The Self&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the past few weeks had a tag-cloud, the word “lunch” would be somewhere near the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made a small breakthrough with a complicated but annoying framework problem, which banked me some serious JFDI energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encountered the best machine mistranslation, maybe, of all time which had me laughing for hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s the news? At the weekend met TPC for some &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; chicken (and TBH even better pork) at a place with a mahoosive queue, followed by a spot visit to a very special HUB. There I was given a scratch card, which won a me game of rock-paper-scissors against the house, and a chance to win the &quot;A+&quot; prize.  My scissors trumped our bartender’s paper.  What did I win? A cute whiskey tumbler: Quite chuffed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Pioneer DJ’s rebrand to AlphaTheta, they’ve brought new design language and products which look phenomenal.  The OmnisDuo is &lt;em&gt;so close&lt;/em&gt; to the entry-level XDJ I’ve spent years wishing for, that every way it falls short feels disappointing.  Resigned to getting a FLX4 at this point.&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6c125f69-a2a0-49b7-a3ff-4bea263e9b9d?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hello, it is me, the floating head of Jor-El.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monumental week: My new bed &amp;amp; sofa arrived.  There’s nothing like a month on a futon (on a laminate wooden floor) to help you appreciate the wonders of a firm mattress.  And having a sofa is game-changing: Now I can drink coffee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got a nice shout-out in the departmental all-hands (thank-you!). Also an announcement about the formation of a new central team, which I’m joining part-time and am pretty chuffed about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s H1 performance review season.  Which, for me, is a great time to reflect on this whole being-an-IC-again thing.  Mirroring my time as an EM, separating the two roles is difficult: I find it far too easy to call on my EM tool-kit in some situations.  But no regrets so far: We trust in the great IC-EM pendulum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday and Friday evenings were spent hanging out until the wee hours.  Thursday I split a cab, and Friday I walked home: my new address is already paying off big time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very glad to see a few people I hadn’t seen in…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Kicking off being proper-grown-up-like by going to the gym &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to the dentist this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every day I track a few things, including my mood and a few sentiment scores, but I didn’t need these numbers to tell me that wasn’t a great week.  Endorphins from the gym and a few nice meals kept me going.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers Club was &lt;em&gt;exceptional&lt;/em&gt; this week.  Not only were we joined by a new member, but I think we hit a record number of “Aha” moments.  The paper we&apos;re reading has some fairly complicated but crucial maths.  The difference was applying the advice of my high-school maths teacher PJ to the equations in the paper, “When in doubt, try it out, with easy numbers”.  So, e.g., a vector of size 2, and a layer of size 3, that sort of thing.  Timeless advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joked about a dinner feeling like a product management meetup a few weeks ago, and, well, it happened again over Duck on Friday.  Perhaps the universe is trying to tell me something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I now have a map with good coffee places that I personally vouch for.  It’s still incomplete while I backload places like London.  But you might enjoy?  &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.app.goo.gl/QkkzxM89yudGxAKWA&quot;&gt;Map here&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
