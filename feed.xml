                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble with doing a long hike on Sunday and then immediately walking to work from Waterloo the following day is that you get massive cramp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing this to the sound of “Cotten-Eyed Joe” in a field in the middle of Hertfordshire.  How did we get here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Career progression in engineering is heavily on my mind this week.  Both the general case, and my own (I think they call this career planning) - and I’ve started writing down some thoughts. It’s hard to write something that includes both a diagnosis of difficulties and some suggestions without it reading a bit like a manifesto but I’m trying.  And also to not make it just about me.  And here we are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furthering a reputation I’d rather I not have, I discovered that a cache of discount cards for the sea-creature pub and started distributing them.  Sorry Euan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gee, the first season of this Succession show is pretty good.  Yes I know I&apos;m several years late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s a lot more to write but I don&apos;t want to miss my inconsequential self…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started porting a subset of a very old PHP+React project to NodeJS this week which was surprisingly fun.  There&apos;s lots of wacky things you can do like parsing &lt;a href=&quot;https://twig.symfony.com/&quot;&gt;Twig&lt;/a&gt; templates as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twigjs/twig.js/&quot;&gt;TwigJS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/&quot;&gt;Nunjucks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml&quot;&gt;turning framework Yaml config into JSON&lt;/a&gt;.  Miraculously the &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file still worked and I remembered how much I loved Class Components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; uplifting 1:1 with our new CTO, and a bittersweet leaving lunch for our old CTO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent some time going over &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; bit of current or future interdepartmental work and sorting them into three feasibility buckets.  Immensely satisfying.  There is now a practical list of things to look at to get the whole lot moving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I outed myself as a reader of a popular tech blog by going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://russelldavies.typepad.com/planning/interesting.html&quot;&gt;Interesting&lt;/a&gt;.  It was pretty good!  I learned a lot about shopping lists and misophonia, and a little bit about blood sugar and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28&quot;&gt;section 28&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mash, Diesel, Sausages, Shortbread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went to Taro for lunch on Saturday and spent the rest of the day playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-1576884.html&quot;&gt;Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.  It&apos;s pretty good.  I preferred the mystique and lore of the first game, but I&apos;m having &lt;em&gt;so much fun&lt;/em&gt; building…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b3b0eb11-6806-4291-9843-603ca1f51980?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short week, but I packed in &lt;em&gt;tonnes&lt;/em&gt;, too much to write about really: We kicked off the thing I mentioned last week (although I haven&apos;t done my homework yet), and some other things got shipped.  Picked up a left-field assignment that had me running around the building to speak to different departments, skimming research papers and writing a Jupyter notebook - all with a slightly stressful deadline that I barely hit - genuinely energising in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a follow-up occupational health appointment and pleasantly realised that while I&apos;m not where I was health-wise at the close of last year, I&apos;m much closer than I was.  Alas, my wait on the NHS continues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes visibly doing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; is more important than invisibly doing &lt;em&gt;the right thing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;(And sometimes a comment in Alex&apos;s week-notes is a comment in Alex&apos;s week-notes!  Nothing to decode here, at least not this time)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also learned why stroke order is important in kana.  Turns out that シ &amp;amp; ツ and ン &amp;amp; ソ are imminently readable once you…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b42894a1-eec7-4459-a4b5-70e13408d9d8?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank holiday week this week, marked by a Monday road-trip to Winchester Service Station to watch the cherry blossom.   Since they were on the way, we also visited Stonehenge to get yelled at by security &amp;amp; Oxford to get yelled at by some cyclists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visiting Oxford was really nice. Spending so much time there as a teen, I did a spot tour of the very centre, ending up at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/oxfordshire/turf-tavern/&quot;&gt;Turf Tavern&lt;/a&gt; where I got to overhear the funniest debate about fishes and metaphysics.  What fish would you be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent a lot of time at work this week with the interactive publishing stack.  On top of recruiting for a small group to work on advancing it (kicking off soon™), I began documenting and building a dashboard for one of the most misunderstood bits of kit. The dashboard has already unpleasantly surprised me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splunk tip of the week: Build a dashboard by starting with data-sources, and chained searches &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; before ever trying to do anything with the user interface.  It&apos;s faster and less confusing.  And remember…&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;| fields nameOfField1, nameOfField2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/0e7d15c3-e714-41c1-96a4-f046cc782601?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upward trajectory this week: Started out feeling fairly unenthused and ended in a much better place.  There&apos;s power to figuring out what&apos;s bothering you, west-winging it and then trying to work through it.  Highly recommended.  Bias for action is coming back, slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week started with a live-coding exercise with one of our journalists.  Quite often technologists will shadow or do various business processes (famously, Nandos encouraging people into kitchens) - so flipping it on its head is a bit novel and I hope we pulled it off?  Maybe we can do more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also had several major outages impacting the homepage this week.  Mostly out-of-hours and all slightly different.  All exhausting.  I got to write a bit of code to help mitigate the last one.  This long weekend is well-deserved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/efinlay24/&quot;&gt;Euan&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s last day was Friday.  Over forty people stopped by for his Thursday send-off - which speaks volumes - it&apos;s probably the most fun I&apos;ve had in a pub all year.  Friday was a very quiet day.  I&apos;ll miss…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a blast writing up how one of our systems (Magnet, for the interested) works.  Went in knowing a lot about how two parts of it worked.  I wrote out an outline around what its main request/response lifecycle worked like and started a deep-dive to fill it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While eating a lunch of katsu curry outside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thened.com/&quot;&gt;The Ned&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.willhoward.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; I became unwitting participants of a China protest.  People walked past waving placards and handing out flyers with QR codes.  The chicken was pretty good, although the portion was huge and I struggled to finish.  Solid 8/10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Men literally only want to talk about two things (Religion &amp;amp; History) and it&apos;s disgusting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday evening I left the office to meet the people at the boozy golfing social, and met the other people at the other boozy golfing social instead.  Then ran from the Seahorse to Nandos: You can do it in ~7 minutes on a good day, I did it in 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My group made an afternoon of teams running through their OKRs.  Genuinely heartwarming seeing so many…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was a short week, but it didn&apos;t feel like a short week.  It really didn&apos;t feel like a short week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This week&apos;s soundtrack is &lt;a href=&quot;https://teenagemutants.bandcamp.com/track/running&quot;&gt;R﻿unning&lt;/a&gt;: a minimal, layered banger that gives me real producer envy]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What are you doing?” came a voice from across the office.  “Looking for isopropyl alcohol” I replied, manner-of-factly, as if it was the most normal thing in the world to be doing in a workplace.  Folks, it was only a matter of time: I spilled some coffee onto a keyboard and needed something non-conductive to clean with.  The keyboard hasn&apos;t been the same since.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m a &lt;a href=&quot;https://logseq.com/&quot;&gt;Logseq&lt;/a&gt; person now.  &lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt;.  It&apos;s another one of these knowledge-management tools (like Obsidian), including the cute little graph, but what&apos;s drew me is that it&apos;s block-based and driven by daily journals.  I try to write notes as I go - either in Notion or on pen &amp;amp; paper (❤️ BuJo) - so this fits my style perfectly.  Giving it a proper go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://codebar.io/workshops/2630&quot;&gt;The FT hosted Codebar on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.  I signed up, either to speak or coach, and…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week has flown by.  Made some small tweaks to this site, reviewed a few technical documents and have started exploring how to do dynamic imports of one-shot code into articles (which is both a personal and a work problem).  There&apos;s a pull-request I need to finish at work that brings more caching improvements.  Writing this mostly for personal accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Met &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://georgecrawford.com/&quot;&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; for what we&apos;re calling a &lt;em&gt;power-breakfast&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.  Who needs drinks after work when you can just talk life, shop and gossip at 8AM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ended up at a nomikai (飲み会) with Japanese colleagues.  Fun chatter.  Reminded me of going to these regularly years ago, only now I understand much more.  Wish I could keep up with more complex conversation though: It&apos;d be nice to practice simpler Japanese with people at my level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone pointed out that Kanji are complicated for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; and so I shouldn&apos;t let them hold me back, so I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan&quot;&gt;Yomichan&lt;/a&gt; (basically a dictionary?) and have been able to read (and write) a little…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Celebrating 2 consecutive years of not being tricked on April fools day.  Maybe it&apos;s a good thing that it fell on a weekend this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spring is here!  I left the office on Monday and for the first time all year it was still light.  I tied both of my Martenitsi onto a tree that was blossoming directly opposite St Pauls, and then made it my mission this week to convince others to add theirs to the same tree.  My mission was successful.  It is now &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martenitsa&quot;&gt;Martenitsa&lt;/a&gt; tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went on a tour of the infrastructure supporting our office on Wednesday. The amount of behind-the-scenes work going into keeping the building running is just incredible and in particular the climate-control: Some of the chonkiest machines are controlling variables like CO2 balance, humidity, temperature and more are all continuously across many small zones for all five tiny floors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday was &lt;a href=&quot;https://cityjsconf.org/&quot;&gt;CityJS conference&lt;/a&gt;, set in the delightful Royal Geographical Society.  Most of the talks were bangers, although my clear fave was Mike Hartington&apos;s talk on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/RdiXuoMPtUA?feature=share&amp;amp;t=21435&quot;&gt;Delighting Users with Performant Apps&lt;/a&gt;.  Great examples of how to make the UI/UX of web-apps fantastic.  Still more difficult to get to a great state than it should…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started the week with a workshop introducing our new technology strategy to the tech-leads and senior engineers working on FT.com. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt; ran through the strategy and its background, and the other technical directors added their insights, we split out into break-out groups to discuss the the two most impactful areas of the strategy.  I think it went well?  Although, I struggled a bit with facilitating because we spoke a little more about process than I was prepared for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In less interesting news I finally made a small tweak to this blog to improve bullet-point spacing, which should make these imminently more readable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrote a product release this week for the first time since 2020, and people have been rather nice about it.  I&apos;ve got another one in-draft but am struggling with narrative.  This is why you write your product hypotheses before building anything folks!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday brought many of my old colleagues from various Nikkei programmes to the office, and it was really nice to catch…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
