                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the trees outside my living room window went into bloom last month.  This week it was covered with snow.  I don&apos;t think this is how spring is supposed to start, but, for the few hours it lasted, it was beautiful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recently I joined a Reforge product management cohort: This week we ran through product strategy frameworks, and discussed the difficulties of translating internal-facing products into frameworks/structures, as many are designed for external-facing products with clear commercials.  Strangely the industry prioritises growth over &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; else.  But improvements to organisational efficiency and efficacy (eg in acquiring/retaining users) &quot;lowers the floor&quot; in ARPU (annual revenue per user) which seems just as effective as growth.  Maybe I&apos;m unique in finding this exciting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excited about news this week that I&apos;m taking on a new team, meaning that I will now oversee all of the engineering teams involved in showing journalism to readers. Have done this before (on a smaller…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small change I quietly released to ft.com last week has received such positive reception that people I wouldn&apos;t even expect to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; about it have commented. I&apos;m used to people celebrating improvements, but this seems really disproportionate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week has been very much about trying to get on with it.  Bias for action and all that.  With the year starting out the way it did, I&apos;ve felt like suboptimal physical &amp;amp; mental health have held me back.  Ahead of planning/reviewing/refining full personal objectives, I&apos;m making decisions towards an intentionally vague &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themesystem.com/&quot;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; I drafted last year.  This month&apos;s priority is getting back on track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspired by that I started taking private Japanese lessons.  Even with a hundred-odd kanji memorised, we&apos;ve deliberately started with the basics, following a highly-structured approach because &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/5bcff697-194c-48a1-a439-9fdc789f6cf1&quot;&gt;last year&apos;s feedback&lt;/a&gt; left me very aware that I don&apos;t sound natural.  Next stop: N5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also had a therapy session this week.  CBT hasn&apos;t really been doing much for me…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/81f4ad1c-d6e4-4d6f-8a92-b8e74a10d9d9?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader, this week I&apos;ve been navigating many teams, systems and process going through a procurement process.  The process itself is actually great and I&apos;m enjoying how far it&apos;s come since the days of endless spreadsheets and Salesforce.  What&apos;s confusing is the specific arrangement I&apos;m pursuing where I can&apos;t find any one person who can tell me what to do or how to do it.  So this week you may call me &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/topic/Josef-K&quot;&gt;Josef&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soon I start working on the problem which I&apos;ve previously referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/topic/product-coexistence&quot;&gt;“Product Coexistence problem“&lt;/a&gt;, which through reframing has become about pragmatically introducing support for extending front-ends.  It&apos;s exciting and should result in pushing technical boundaries in a constructive way.  I&apos;m excited about the implications for one-shot content, like, say, the interactive charts we publish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last week when I mentioned I was coming down with something, it turned out that I had mostly-asymptomatic Covid, which I wouldn&apos;t have caught without routine testing. Other than a sore throat on Saturday I didn&apos;t have a single trace. Goes to show that testing helps. And this net trend towards milder symptoms is &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/2eb20c54-1cf0-4801-8733-ab7a4a481f96?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s a genuine spark of wonder that I&apos;ve been feeling recently as I&apos;ve been discovering and learning about the more obscure parts of the FT.com stack.  Last year my assignments kept me away from the less maintained systems and so it&apos;s been surprisingly fun seeing how people approached problems several years ago - and years later, seeing how t approach aged.heir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That isn&apos;t a popular opinion and it definitely isn&apos;t how I&apos;ll always feel.  Years ago I&apos;d actively &lt;em&gt;sworn&lt;/em&gt; at old code (although in my defence I defy anyone not to swear at the logic of recursive cURL calls in PHP!).   But, there&apos;s a big difference between spelunking through systems in an exploratory way, and doing so while trying to ship a specific feature on a deadline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CBT is, you know, fine.  I&apos;m in it for the long-haul I guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bear with me: &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f2c2faa-cc8d-4c83-b2e4-048d5d893a27&quot;&gt;Last year I got an Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt;.  And, last week I got a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Urbz:_Sims_in_the_City&quot;&gt;The Urbz&lt;/a&gt;.  It seemed like a good way to all this spend time in recovery.  Only one problem, some unlocks in the game require multiplayer.  So I bought a GBA linker cable for £3, dumped my save file and re-read &lt;a href=&quot;https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbacartbackupids&quot;&gt;how GBA saves work&lt;/a&gt; so I could…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/0ca489c6-34ba-4571-84b9-4084c8ae318f?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week someone said &quot;it&apos;s almost March&quot;.  Mate.  I&apos;ve barely noticed it&apos;s not January any more.  &lt;em&gt;Not cool&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The trouble with changing old systems is that sometimes you end up navigating a Kafkaesque confusion of package managers.  I wrote some code, improved some tests and while trying to deploy it all fell into a battle with nested dependencies.  At time of writing, the dependencies are winning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m glad that the promotions round is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://alex.mullr.net/&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; bakes a pretty mean cookie!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a slightly welcome distraction, Mum stayed the weekend and we spent the time exploring Barnes and Fulham.  Ended up eating Golubtsy/Голубцы for dinner and being surprised at the season 2 finale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polygon.com/23589160/nintendo-direct-2023-february-date-time-zelda-advance-wars&quot;&gt;Nintendo direct this week&lt;/a&gt; was pretty cool.  Expect to hear more gushing about it imminently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh crap, I should probably get to doing that write-up of 2022 huh?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have had trouble sleeping this week.  I can&apos;t place if it&apos;s random, stress or something else.  But with this journey I&apos;ve been on recently…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F﻿irst week all year not involving time in a hospital. Mixed feelings. Hopefully first of many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nice recovery milestone, during the week I&apos;ve been working on a small improvement to caching for the website to improve the durability and predictability of article pages, which I&apos;m hoping to start testing over the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.londonwinterrun.co.uk/news/2023-london-route-revealed/&quot;&gt;that race I signed up for&lt;/a&gt;?  Today was race day.  The running group invited me to join them for food, but I couldn&apos;t quite stomach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I did end up eating out a lot this week: &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/PK8JvUoKJSgTZ3Z28&quot;&gt;Champor-Champor&lt;/a&gt; served up the best Massaman curry I&apos;ve ever tasted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/k4CrU1NUSqso4jgE7&quot;&gt;Taro Pimlico&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s miso soup stole the show &amp;amp; Wagamama&apos;s new billing system is a kafkaesque nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never thought I&apos;d say this: I miss cardio.  Weirdly, I don&apos;t miss booze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986410/&quot;&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/a&gt; is abnormally good and I&apos;m highly disappointed it took me so long to discover. &lt;em&gt;“Beard After Hours”&lt;/em&gt; hit hard. Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegadhian.com/&quot;&gt;Arjun&lt;/a&gt; for nudging me to push through the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week I properly started on my next big assignment, which is to refine and improve how visual and data stories are produced.  It&apos;s slightly messy (and big) work since it fits between several teams, but I&apos;m already seeing major opportunities to make things significantly better - and am thrilled to have a brand new problem space to explore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nickramsbottom.com/&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; left the FT this week, and given the chance to say a few words during his goodbye so I plugged a few anecdotes into ChatGPT. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/alexwilson/7b0d9b1a68a7d25ee7191f8be354f3c1&quot;&gt;The resulting speech&lt;/a&gt; was surprisingly good and got a few laughs.  However it really started to struggle when I asked it to generate actual humour.  &quot;A-Nick-ating&quot; was its idea of a pun and I still don&apos;t understand it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promotions round is done: Phew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday afternoon we ran a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goosechase.com/&quot;&gt;Goose chase&lt;/a&gt; at work.  Our team started out strong and we stayed tied first right up until the final mission, where not even Tobias&apos;s epic sprint to the final spot could hold our lead against &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.computer/&quot;&gt;Kara&lt;/a&gt;.  We ended in third place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday morning I had…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/a95f0389-50ab-4fc4-9d67-1da093a0b5cd?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader, this week I learned why you &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; put a cannula in your dominant arm.  You become hyper-aware of every movement you make.  It&apos;s really quite unpleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My sister stayed the weekend as part of a London-based training course she&apos;s doing, and the timing ended up being excellent given the main event this week.  We ate Korean and talked about Pokémon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the trail of my spooky symptoms, I went back to the ER mid-week and spent some time in hospital going through a litany of tests.  And I finally have walked out with a diagnosis &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a treatment plan which I won&apos;t talk about much yet.  But importantly, the anxiety is waning.  And once again I can only thank the NHS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know &lt;a href=&quot;https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife&quot;&gt;that trope&lt;/a&gt; where Alice saves Bob&apos;s life, and Bob acts super weird about being indebted to Alice?  I used to dismiss it as being a weird little story device, but I now understand it, and it just about brings me to tears. There is a particular doctor who listened, took me seriously, popped by to check on me…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/e368eb5e-c9c5-4482-bf10-1161dd27982f?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iconic week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real highlight was a team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linastores.co.uk/&quot;&gt;lunch&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, welcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://georgecrawford.com/&quot;&gt;George&lt;/a&gt; to our team. I quietly made a real mess of some grilled king prawns and failed to hide the evidence. We all had affogato for dessert and talked about music notation. Welcome George!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly bittersweet, this was my last week as acting tech director of FT.com: reflections on that as part of 2022 review ... &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shorter notes again this week: I&apos;ve spent a lot of it recovering. This thing hit me hard. I&apos;m glad that the NHS was there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The uncertainty of my symptoms led to something of an anxiety tailspin this week. It got &lt;em&gt;spookier&lt;/em&gt;. And while I&apos;m feeling far better now, this kind of thing is scary and can come on fast so - reminder that mental health is no joke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And did you know anxiety affects blood pressure?  I&apos;ve seen the numbers, it&apos;s no joke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alongside one therapy referral, I&apos;m going through a slew of long-overdue tests with my GP.  In some countries there are annual physicals: For peace of mind I sorta…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back at work this week, kinda. With difficulties in getting around by train, I&apos;ve been working remotely from assorted Birmingham coffee shops.  Last time I did this was apparently December 2019!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://circleci.com/blog/january-4-2023-security-alert/&quot;&gt;CircleCI breach&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/&quot;&gt;ever-worsening LastPass breach&lt;/a&gt; are a slightly disturbing trend, eh?  Starting to think that putting secrets in the cloud was never a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In very related news, the buzz-word of the week is rotating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short notes this week: During a run I developed some spooky symptoms which ended up with me in the ER - the conclusion is a particularly nasty migraine. Genuinely freaked out by this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also had some coursework deadlines on Monday, but since I let them know about the migraine, UoL have been kind enough to grant me an extra week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
