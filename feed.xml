                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this week I made a few small break-throughs culminating in the realisation that: If after &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; week I suspected that cleaning, sorting and separating garbage was about to become a big part of my life - Now after &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; I know the remainder will become all about points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤑 PayPay points earned: 1215pts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍋 Vitamin C consumed: 3690mg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏬 Second-hand stores searched: 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left  I asked around a bit, “If I’m bringing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omiyage&quot;&gt;souvenir/gift from our culture&lt;/a&gt; what should it be?”  The answers were many, but a consensus formed split somewhere between M&amp;amp;S Shortbread (you know, the blue tin? yes &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; blue tin. You know.) and tea.  Shortbread seemed more practical.  Anyway I brought it in this week and it went down a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally booked into some language lessons, starting in January...  I&apos;m excited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One big change this week is that after a lot (and I mean a lot) of wrangling, my Apple account is now a Japanese one.  Meaning that at the cost of losing access to a few apps, I now have access to some incredibly useful ones: Such as PayPay.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b61e1e29-750d-4cb2-87e3-37411b6c716b?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week felt considerably more normal than last week. Maybe the routine got me somewhere. Maybe it’s just the jet lag having worn off. Maybe it’s the nature of the life-admin changing. Maybe it’s something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📼 Training videos watched: 5 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌯 Team lunches: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍵 Oi Ocha consumed: 3.5 litres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt my first earthquake in yonks &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.data.jma.go.jp/multi/quake/quake_detail.html?eventID=20241204191551&amp;amp;lang=jp&quot;&gt;on Tuesday evening&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a while (maybe 5 years?) so I’d forgotten how it feels. Intensity 1 so nobody else was even remotely fussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first week at work, and I’m feeling the same sense of awe and wonder one does exploring any new world. I’m pretty excited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of onboarding, or, I guess, being in a large company is needing an evergreen way of introducing yourself - and so one of my tasks involved writing a page about myself for an internal documentation hub.  (It also includes a link to the about me page on this blog, which, is somewhat out of date - sorry!)  It’s kind-of great, and reading others I realised that there’s lots to strike up conversations about.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/8c466999-be7c-4fb0-9f32-6bd5ff22899a?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of these weird weeks where I didn’t have much on - because it was my time off between two jobs. It was a bit like a staycation?  But in a new place?  Lots of life-admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did I leave you?  Ah yes, watching Garfield on the plane.  Tray table went up, we landed, we taxied and we disembarked. Now for the moment I was dreading: I went to the immigration counter for residents and was presented with my very own residence card.  Phew - that was easy.  And then both it and my passport were taken from me and I was asked to take a seat and wait.  Uh-oh.  After what felt like an eternity (a few minutes) both were handed back and I was allowed through: I’d given the wrong post-code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collected my bags, and met an agent who handed me my SIM card, keys, and a few other bits I’d need, before escorting me to a taxi.  On the way I plug in my new SIM card on the way, message a few people to let them know I’ve landed.  Before I knew it, we’ve arrived and I’m standing alone on a brand new street with two suitcases, a backpack and some documents to keep me company.  And I now understand the confusion at border control: There&apos;s no building by the name I&apos;ve been given.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/5db865f1-cefa-4378-a4c3-d315da8cb8cc?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my last week at the FT, something I kept &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; close to my chest.  It surprised a few people.  Truth be told it didn’t really sink in for me until this week.  I spent the entire week trying to remain composed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why leave?  The exit survey poses that question expectantly.  It’s simple: I’m relocating and circumstances [editor’s note: &lt;em&gt;including&lt;/em&gt; but not only my age] made now the right time.  Where to?  Tokyo.  I’ve wanted to do it since 2017, so, you know.  That’s why.  This has been in the works for a  hot minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🥪 Pret eaten: 7 sandwiches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚶 People who said they plan to visit Japan next year: 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🎬 Movies watched: 6 films&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between packing and leaving a job.  I began the week with a todo list as long as my arm...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people reached out to chat.  Some wished me luck.  Some said kind things. All of them — some of whom might be reading this — in reaching out made leaving just that little bit harder.  Thank-you?  But, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common question I got was “Do you speak any japanese?” to which I answered “少し話せます”, or, a little. The second most common question was “Are you packed yet?” to which I answered “No, but that’s not the problem - it’s getting rid of my furniture and all the other things I’m not packing!”...&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/198b3ab3-2b8d-4da8-8881-1262d3eb2366?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hello from sunny Birmingham.  The weather has been alternating between rain and grey all weekend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in data:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magazines issues thrown into a recycling bin: 37&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heartfelt emails sent: 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent some time steeling myself for a few conversations that I thought would be difficult.  No, reader, they all went swimmingly well.  I’m genuinely pleasantly surprised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got here in a van: Despite having multiple train lines from Birmingham to London, it’s somehow still quicker to drive from my flat in London to my parents home in Birmingham. Or at least, it should have been: It took &lt;em&gt;nearly 30 minutes&lt;/em&gt; to drive down Putney High Street alone.  Sheesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluesky is really popping off huh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L helped me with some more chores. Later we played some music, &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/2024-11-17-set&quot;&gt;first semi-seriously&lt;/a&gt; and later after giving up &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/axwnmusic/genresweep-afterparty-2&quot;&gt;just committed some crimes&lt;/a&gt; with my apparently now &lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt; mixer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the (painful, at least to me) mistakes that was still a pretty technically advanced set and I&apos;m pretty proud of how far I&apos;ve come since picking DJing back up in 2020. It&apos;s such a fun hobby. And it&apos;s a very different, really intimate — and almost &lt;em&gt;therapeutic&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/c6208cb1-57cb-4cc0-986e-19a6856c391a?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of my week was spent with the US elections, making sure that reporting worked as well as it could.  Looking after the systems and tools telling the news makes it easier to detach from the news.  However it isn’t always easy to &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; detached: That’s the rub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧦 Sponsored socks worn: 3 pairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍖 Meat consumed: 0 grams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📧 Emails deleted: 6251 threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/alexwilson.bsky.social/post/3lagsxmbrd72y&quot;&gt;Bluesky is now my primary social media network&lt;/a&gt;.  If you don’t already, give me a follow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ig.ft.com/us-elections/2024/results/president&quot;&gt;Coverage of the US election&lt;/a&gt; took up the entirety of the first few days of the week, with Tuesday and Wednesday turning into something of an all-nighter.  We were prepared for a several-day marathon, but it quickly became clear that this was much shorter (yet faster) sprint instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all went rather smoothly.  We got some delightful feedback from some readers — and several million page-views in the first day.  That’s the upside, or, a “reason to be cheerful” as GC would put it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot can change in thirty hours: There&apos;s now a lot of commentary floating around, and with the exception of a few interesting anecdotes such as The Bronx being the biggest swing, I&apos;m mostly blocking it out. &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; the hit-pieces rushing to apportion some blame.  &lt;em&gt;Mostly those, actually&lt;/em&gt;.  It isn&apos;t that I&apos;m apolitical — I am not — or even that I want this blog to be: I am just still processing, as I&apos;m sure many others are too.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/37fdd22f-4b69-491e-86ba-a84ae72a0646?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent a lot of the week helping with various aspects of US election coverage next week. Some assorted tasks and a real deep-dive into web performance and maps, the latter which I’ve not done much work with before. Managed to get a 75% performance improvement in a crucial area which I’m quite happy with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in numbers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ebay listings created: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red-meat consumed: 0 grams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Headphones thrown away: 1.5 pairs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting to like React Hooks.  Yeah, I’ve not been thrilled at them until now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LF and I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DBt44ZLoQdB&quot;&gt;Baron’s Bites&lt;/a&gt;, which was a League of Legends pop-up/takeover of &lt;a href=&quot;https://butchies.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Butchies&lt;/a&gt;.  Was it worth the twenty-minute queue?  No.  But I got a badge, which I gave away later that same evening.  I paid £11 for their finest plant-based nuggets which started out strong and ended in regret.  The queue seemed friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Apple Intelligence update dropped.  Um.  It’s not great, is it?  Here’s a doozy: “Cow sighting; desperate for cow manure”.  Here’s another: “One soup through a straw, deemed…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/f1a69fcd-90b7-4838-af82-fa5ff93a05e8?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low energy start to the week: I had Monday off, and ended up taking part of Tuesday off too. I’ve been feeling a little under the weather, but I think now slowly on the mend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individual shoes thrown away: 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How long it took me to realise the clocks went back: 18 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total of all payments made in cash: £17&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have glasses now, sort-of.  I can see totally fine without them - but over the years I’ve developed an astigmatism and so they’re really helping with situations with contrasting bright lights.  Still figuring out when to wear them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In very exciting work news, CCC — which I’ve here and &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/46dcc1c2-4791-4410-9065-e63318554381&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; since its kick-off last April — is now finally live, debuted this week by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/10489c19-aecc-43e4-947f-bfde497de7b9&quot;&gt;Joanna Kao’s excellent article on AI-assisted accessibility tooling, and how they aren’t what they seem&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a monumental effort getting there and the change seems subtle, but is profound: Previously an article with inline functionality like that would not work on the main website or app.  The same is true of most news organisations and so I&apos;m very excited to see where this capability goes!&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Saw the king’s official transport going through the City of London again.  There’s nothing too interesting for me to say about it but it felt noteworthy at the time.  Some tourists might’ve been impressed, but living here I’ve lost that magic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week in numbers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🕸️ Domains purchased: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📞 Phone-calls: 22&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍲 Soup consumed: 2.2L&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a few conversations this week which I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; enjoyed.  I mixed a few different tools/techniques which let me keep them short and structured: Think coaching blended with the 5-whys, fuelled by active note-taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On my backburner is the general problem of, “How to orchestrate/instrument R?”  The closest I’ve come is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openmetrics/index.html&quot;&gt;openmetrics&lt;/a&gt; library, but what I really want is to see where a pipeline might be failing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re ever wondering if you should sort your data client-side or server-side, the answer is: both!  A comparison sort (A&amp;gt;B, or: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Array.sort((a,b) =&amp;gt; (b-a))&lt;/code&gt;) has linear complexity so is cheap to run client-side if data is already sorted, and it’s a good defence mechanism…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short week this week: In part &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/3bfacc72-7403-4759-b921-6aad69f68c5d&quot;&gt;because of last week&lt;/a&gt; it started on Tuesday morning, and in another part because my weekend got capped. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌿 Plant-based dinners: 3/6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🎚️ Missed buttdials from DJs: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💉 Cannulas worn: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week’s terrible eating and drinking led me this week to notch up my New Health Century. I ate &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; vegetables this week. Tim Spector would be proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I had a week for the assignment I got last week, it turns out that no, I had until EOP Tuesday. I&apos;d already set-up a meeting with the most important peer to bounce ideas off, so I put together a scratch document with a lot of messy notes outlining exactly which technical problems underpinned the challenge we&apos;d been set, and transposed them into some much clearer bullet-points in the shared, working document. Got a spot edit, with very minor corrections, and some good feedback about it the following day so I&apos;m pretty chuffed with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our CTO hosted a remote-first &quot;senior technology staff get-together&quot; this week which brought many of us together informally to chat about various topics. I actually loved the chance to connect with colleagues I hadn&apos;t properly spoken to before, or hadn&apos;t worked with/seen in ages.  Real highlight of the week - and better yet she has encouraged us to use the format if we like it.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
