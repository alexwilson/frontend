                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week marked the first few planning sessions to enable micro-frontends, or extensions.  I&apos;ve been using the story mapping format to walk through end-to-end journeys and draw up epics and tickets.  We got quite far, and we&apos;re on the cusp of starting to drive a few standards.  I love wearing this hat in projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also published a blog post about that work and generally the reception has been really nice.  I worry that I went too in-depth with the technical details, and now reading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agilecommshandbook.com/&quot;&gt;Agile Comms Handbook&lt;/a&gt; I&apos;m considering how to better brand this work - both to describe the short-term (which is intentionally small!) and the promise of the long-term.  The balance is off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sagemaker is such a headache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summer is a funny time of year: They say that things slow down, but &lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt; that they speed up.  Those going away on holiday want to see things happen while they&apos;re away.  Those coming back from holiday want to see things happen now that they&apos;re back.  One of these years I&apos;ll become one of these smart, smart people - take &lt;em&gt;holidays&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f27fe5f-243f-4b65-8e14-c8236ec36914?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week&apos;s big theme at work was architecture and planning for Extensible Frontends: I&apos;ve arrived at what seems like a reasonable proposal.  I&apos;ve pared back the scope to just enabling deployments, and am trying to be as unopinionated as possible about what is actually deployed, because research has proven that opinions are a big ongoing investment.  In the coming weeks the new team (which also gathered for the first time this week) breaks ground, but we need to better socialise this first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elections are now also officially kicked-off.  Lots to do, not much time to do it in.  Busy, busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately this week&apos;s efforts in machine-learning land were not that successful: The good news is that models are running, the bad news is that in AWS-land it&apos;s pretty boilerplate-intensive to train (or fine-tune) a model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One fun distraction, was stumbling upon a critical security vulnerability affecting several of my older projects and I got in touch with my old teams to help them mitigate the…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/cfd56234-9e54-4487-b917-aef18c059537?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working at the FT for a long time, finally this week I made a change to the homepage.  And then I made another one.  Both worked out fine, although they&apos;re small so you won&apos;t see anything.  Smol milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lxds I did it, I&apos;ve got a Splunk dashboard named after me.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6dcc00c2-ac66-4569-b76b-e17c3114c264&quot;&gt;Remember the hackathon?&lt;/a&gt;  Turns out I was sending a large number of requests.  Probably because my Google Script add-on implemented retries, and I was sending at least 200 individual requests, therefore maybe accidentally doing a denial-of-service against our internal LLM.  Whoops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also spent a bit of time this week supporting my team in editorial with adopting notebooks via SageMaker.  It&apos;s off to a rocky start so far, but it&apos;s mostly AWS related challenges - permissions and images and such.  I really wish AWS was significantly more user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I spent a couple of hours on a 10%-time project that I&apos;ve been excited about for a while, which is restoring some of the digital signage I worked on several years ago.  Mostly spent the time scaffolding out a new project (porting from PHP to Node) and exploring data.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlight of this week was prepping and giving a presentation to kick-off some work I&apos;ve been doing since June, the thing I&apos;ve referred to as the &quot;product coexistence&quot; problem, or as we&apos;ve been calling it, &quot;extensible frontends&quot;.  The main thing I wanted to get from the kick-off was getting alignment, and I think we did it.  Also I designed a timeline chart which I&apos;m weirdly proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mid-year review was on Wednesday.  On the whole, really nice feedback.  Some feedback came up about how I do (or seem to do) too much, which I need to ponder a bit: My strategy has been having no more than 3 big things in-flight at a time (they tend to run on, so, you know) - and &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I may have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/prioritising-in-tech-leadership.html#rocks-pebbles-and-sand-to-focus-our-time&quot;&gt;Rocks, Pebbles and Sand problem&lt;/a&gt;.  I think she&apos;s right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdest thing I did this week was find and buy a single Macbook key.  The minus key.  A few months ago I damaged one of the keys, and it has slowly come loose.  I managed to find one online and after swapping out the assembly my keyboard is as good as new.  &lt;em&gt;(Screen still needs a clean!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/d1d03567-affa-4737-833d-b2b03106a334?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week marked the FT&apos;s first hackday in two years.  The theme was AI and we had just over a day to try and build something interesting.  It was loads of fun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My team of EH, AC, OO, FS and I started out by trying to generate video accompaniments to articles - but after realising that the videos were rather long, we pivoted towards video shorts (think: tiktok).  To enable our hack, I wrote a cursed integration between google sheets and our internal LLM.  We managed to create a few videos but it&apos;s nowhere near ready for prime-time: we didn&apos;t win, but we did get a few laughs and a shout-out from the judges!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some teams built some really cool stuff!  Including a novel chat based UI for interacting with the site (one that actually seemed quite fresh) and a Nikkei team built a tool for geolocation for use in investigative journalism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday marked Arjun&apos;s birthday and for lack of rain we went on a mission to infiltrate another drinks: In the end we were invited and so the mission failed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing the theme of Machine-Learning, I picked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.credly.com/badges/0bc35463-7478-4b67-88b3-0060d78feee8&quot;&gt;IBM&apos;s AI Engineering certification&lt;/a&gt; back up (having paused it in 2020) and finished the whole thing over the weekend.  Lots of repeated content, but also…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6dcc00c2-ac66-4569-b76b-e17c3114c264?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another busy week, week 2 of midterms.  But they&apos;re over now, &lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Monday, in part to celebrate handing in my first two midterm assignments, and in part because I&apos;d already made these plans, I went to see the new Mission Impossible movie with AD and CR.  It was good!  Lots of build, especially in the run-up to Part 2.  I couldn&apos;t stop noticing that in every shot Tom Cruise managed to make himself look so tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent a lot of time this week talking to people about how to staff an upcoming technical strategy initiative.  And then the rest doing the first of a few interviews with people who worked on similar projects in the past, where I learned loads.  A major theme was finding novel ways to remove the felt constraints of our organisational structure - moving past &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law&quot;&gt;Conway&apos;s law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegadhian.com/posts/rolling-out-cms-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Spark team&lt;/a&gt; ran a hack-week this week, and I joined their presentation on Friday to see some of the results.  All great stuff, but my favourites were an experimental implementation of push-notifications…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/5ede8da6-7556-4e74-bd8c-ce5c9de3bbad?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busy week. No video-games for Alex this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarised a few months of design-work into a technical-design-doc this week, and circulated it around to get a bunch of feedback.  It speaks to including code in FT articles, in a similar way to something I&apos;m considering doing on this blog.  Very excited about this work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had my first 1:1 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://alicebartlett.co.uk&quot;&gt;Alice&lt;/a&gt; this week which was great. Given that it was one of the first meetings in her new role, it prompted me to write what I&apos;m calling reverse-manager-README: It&apos;s an experimental document inspired by a conversation with &lt;a href=&quot;https://nickramsbottom.com&quot;&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt; about how bringing context about the quirks of managing you would be nice for managers. I&apos;ve never written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://svnk.github.io/manager-READMEs&quot;&gt;manager-readme&lt;/a&gt; because they seem a bit impersonal, but this exercise has given me second thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday evening I went to a Nikkei dinner with &lt;a href=&quot;https://lukeblaney.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt; and JK at a steakhouse where - after talking about how it&apos;s a long-term aspiration - I was floored by someone asking me &quot;What&apos;s your strategy to move to Japan?&quot;.  I hope I handled it well!  For now I am only focusing on language.  We talked a little bit about cyber-attacks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043-this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends&quot;&gt;This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends&lt;/a&gt; came up — an absolutely phenomenal read.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/706b48da-5725-4748-98ae-868b04a208d2?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh, we&apos;re past the Summer Solstice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday morning I showed up bright and early at the radiology unit for a follow-up scan.  I really wasn&apos;t looking forward to the cannula but it was all fine, and the nurses added and removed it without leaving any bruising - which is a genuine first for any of the needles stuck in my arm this year.  The contrast dye made me feel nauseous — unfortunately I didn&apos;t pick up any super-powers from the process.  &lt;em&gt;Yet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work was a blur this week and I somehow picked up extra assignments while trying to mind my own business, but the main highlight was OKR day.  Just over three hours of presentation spread out over an entire day, leaving lots of room for coffees, an impromptu team lunch and a social in the tiny room above Watling Street.  Recharged (or drained?!) my social battery in a good way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday marked Ant day.  Happy Ant day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picked up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.streetfighter.com/6&quot;&gt;Street Fighter 6&lt;/a&gt; this weekend and on top of going through Arcade Mode, I&apos;ve eclipsed the 100 online matches mark.  It&apos;s so goddamn fun, and is making for a nice break from Zelda.  It definitely feels like at least one character is unbalanced so I&apos;m hoping Capcom will continue working at it.  What&apos;s most interesting is an entirely new build-your-own-fighter mode, which comes with a cringey single-player campaign.  Also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UKlVx16mx4&quot;&gt;music slaps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmv8HwUvc-k&quot;&gt;like seriously&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two last days in one week, working absolute wonders for my separation anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried blocking off time this week to focus on an area of technical strategy, but with the influx of end-of-q2 and end-of-h1 activities couldn&apos;t really make any.  Slightly annoyed at that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Anna&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; last actual day was on Monday - we went for lunch to Lina Stores which was lovely even if the affogato was bittersweet.  Anna has been a great boss, and with the move to CTO I&apos;m really excited for her.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We gave an update to our Nikkei counterparts about the progress we&apos;ve made in enabling new story formats for the FT, and seeing just how much we&apos;ve achieved in a year is pretty phenomenal.  We also gave a sneak-peak at a new secret article page feature we&apos;re working on which I&apos;m super-excited about and believe will be &lt;em&gt;game-changing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My entire team went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/events/leadingeng-london-2023&quot;&gt;LeadingEng&lt;/a&gt; this year which was fantastic, if only because it meant the we could form a meta-clique between the current and former FT people, just like we did last year at &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffconf.org/&quot;&gt;FFconf&lt;/a&gt;.  The talks were great - I&apos;ve got some notes but am not sure if I should do a full write-up since there was so much overlap with last year.  My main takeaway was actually on better ways of…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Monday I woke in Sofia and went to bed on Tuesday in London.  Still reeling from that change.  Said several hurried &quot;Goodbyes&quot; after lunch, and then after getting a row to myself on the plane, said several-more hurried &quot;Hellos&quot; in London before dragging some people to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/jurikohno/&quot;&gt;Juri&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/city-academy-voices-choir-back-in-business-tickets-611005342427&quot;&gt;sing&lt;/a&gt;.  Great concert and friendly band.  Should have skipped the chuhi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OK now that I&apos;ve padded out the word-count for previews, I shall attempt to bury the lede: I experienced a close loss this weekend and it&apos;s still sinking in.  What&apos;s most painful is not having said goodbye.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my teams had a team-day this week.  I missed the retrospective because it was in the morning, but got to join in with the session around reviewing the mission and trying to write some team behavioural principles.  We wrapped with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/umbobabo&quot;&gt;Umberto&lt;/a&gt; hosting a game of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_(game_show)&quot;&gt;Would I Lie To You&lt;/a&gt;, where I successfully(?) managed to convince everybody that I was &lt;em&gt;lying&lt;/em&gt; about bringing a backup sandwich to long drinks and parties.  What did &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; achieve…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
