                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December is here.  After the last two being two lockdown-driven letdowns, finding the holiday spirit is a bit more difficult, but I’m optimistic.  The main obstacle is unpredictable trains, with strikes and other cancellations due later this month, but still hoping to see family this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overnight groceries are great: All the fun of spontaneous purchases with the savings of bulk buys. The only downside is having to wake up at 7AM on a Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spent most of this week preparing for end-of-year reviews, looking at options in recruiting and reacting to a few operational concerns.  It’s the final stretch of the year now so everything that comes in is earmarked urgent - including a surprise risk-mitigation project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight this week was my team all getting together in-person for the first time since summer.  It was for a workshop - but - the workshop started super late so while we waited, we had a proper natter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-scribe/dp/B09BSQ365J&quot;&gt;Kindle Scribe&lt;/a&gt; arrived a day early. First impressions: It’s a great e-reader, and the writing experience is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;.  Marking-up PDFs works like a charm.  However its organisation options are no better than a regular Kindle, holding it back from being a notepad replacement. Perhaps most disappointingly, taking notes in…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/ccc31a35-8676-4ee2-8e87-e75e0e2b28ef?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of our more obscure systems had a relatively complex outage this week, and I&apos;m left wondering why one might use &lt;a href=&quot;https://database.guide/what-is-a-stored-procedure/&quot;&gt;stored procedures&lt;/a&gt; in modern application design.  They&apos;re difficult to version and test, and with relational databases you&apos;re already getting complex aggregations happening inside the query and data-mapping layers!  Major kudos to the engineers who figured this out and repaired the database schema.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I repped the FT at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com&quot;&gt;Silicon Milkroundabout&lt;/a&gt; again - really starting to enjoy these. There&apos;s something quite nice about chatting to technologists about what they&apos;re doing, what we&apos;re doing and where they might find a fit at the FT. Exhausting though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rakugo artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rakugo.lol&quot;&gt;Katsura Sunshine&lt;/a&gt; performed at our office this week. I hadn&apos;t had much exposure to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakugo&quot;&gt;Rakugo&lt;/a&gt; but always imagined it to be quite dry so nearly gave it a miss. Very glad that I didn&apos;t, because it was incredibly fun - and might even be a highlight of the year. Katsura Sunshine did an intro and told several stories, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ8Tq5EotaE&quot;&gt;Jugemu (relatively short)&lt;/a&gt; and I think I&apos;m now hooked. It turns out there are several English-speaking performers now - so definitely something to check-out…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/e3aec8aa-d442-49a9-8f15-63e1e0356ef9?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As we approach December, the days are getting shorter and wetter.  This was a particularly short week as I&apos;ve started taking time off until the end of the year.  It&apos;s crept up quickly - all the plans of doing travel this year have been quashed by the reality of pricing.  So instead I&apos;m trying to write a bit more, make music and go for slightly longer runs.  Chasing those endorphins, &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you join a team with (avg.) 7+ years of systems and history, &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect&quot;&gt;Git Bisect&lt;/a&gt; takes on a whole new use in discovering historic design decisions.  This week I used it to learn about cache-strategy implementation.  Seriously powerful, but I wish there were friendlier ways of using it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday marked Engine Room, the FT&apos;s internal conference.  Many of the talks were really fantastic and it&apos;s probably unfair to call any out because they were all rather good - but particular standouts included &lt;a href=&quot;http://hack.nikkei.com&quot;&gt;guest speakers from Nikkei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghost.computer&quot;&gt;Kara&lt;/a&gt; playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_UrhB1G4gA&quot;&gt;a modular set&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://leemoody.co.uk&quot;&gt;Lee&lt;/a&gt; baking the best babka you&apos;ve had in years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the pouring Kensington rain, on Wednesday we went to dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://samadaliraqirestaurant.com&quot;&gt;Samad Al Iraqi&lt;/a&gt;.  The portions were huge and the Lamb Quzi was divine, but the real star of the show was the meal we didn&apos;t eat: Masgouf.  Fresh fish sliced, smoked and cooked over an open fire for two hours.  It smelled incredible.  The flames were hypnotic.  We watched two men order it and slowly drink tea as they waited, only…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/a4253518-d0d9-475b-81f4-89a576e4baad?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m still doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinzoe.com/&quot;&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt; tests.  Monday was the roughest day, involving eating 5 specially crafted &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinzoe.com/post/muffin-metabolism-predict&quot;&gt;muffins&lt;/a&gt;.  What&apos;s wrong with muffins?  They were fine, but I felt &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strange the entire day.  There was a blood-test too.  It didn&apos;t help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of the week I&apos;ve been doing their blood-sugar challenges, meaning eating specific foods at specific times and watching the impact on a glucose monitor.  Today that was a breakfast of plain white rice with almond butter.  Was it a weird food combination? Yes.  Was it delicious?  &lt;em&gt;Oh my god&lt;/em&gt; yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I messed up and accidentally deleted my Substack account &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/4a1f26b1-6ac4-4300-9867-1265b5946bdb&quot;&gt;and wrote about it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday meant Pisco-sours: What an excellent cocktail.  Dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mirafloreslondon.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Miraflores&lt;/a&gt;, anybody?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Friday I went to Brighton for ffconf, both for the first time.  Brighton is great (the fish &amp;amp; chips are actually better) and I now totally get why people keep moving there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ffconf was a real vibe: The talks were all bangers and I took away lots of ideas &amp;amp; frameworks for building a better, more-ethical &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;more-fun&lt;/em&gt; web.  I spent the entire time catching up with FT colleagues old-and-new (we were probably the biggest group there) and slightly regret not meeting anyone new.  But…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/32353f5b-c6a6-4983-85ad-4ebce675693e?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;How many Substack accounts do you have?  Or rather, how many email addresses do you have?  This is the story of how collecting a few of both surprised me, how I recovered and how you can too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: Substack is not at fault here, this was entirely my own doing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Summary
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substack implements &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2919.txt&quot;&gt;RFC-2919&lt;/a&gt; allowing us to programmatically get every list we&apos;ve ever been subscribed to as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;List-Id&lt;/code&gt; in any mail client.  Standards are &lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Gmail&apos;s search or API, we can retrieve emails from Substack using &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;from:substack.com&lt;/code&gt;.  And, to filter by payment receipts: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;subject:&quot;your payment receipt&quot; from:substack.com&lt;/code&gt;.  Using Google Apps Script we can programmatically aggregate these messages into a handy list, &lt;a href=&quot;https://script.google.com/d/1SbHnmBnbn_MJohHDoV0DIGNpa4PDTIiidBBg0BQIY8Jn9MhnPK7GRC0X/edit&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newsletters being emails made it easy to retrieve this information, but, by backing this data up sooner I could have avoided the trouble altogether.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
How I messed up
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&apos;ve used a few different email addresses.  With newsletters growing in popularity and so many being sent via Substack, that &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; meant I&apos;d collected several Substack accounts.  Thankfully &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037489072-How-do-I-change-my-email-address-&quot;&gt;it&apos;s easy to merge these accounts&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November is here and the weather has taken a turn. Pumpkin spice lattes are over. This weekend I’ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/?status=REC&amp;amp;version=latest&quot;&gt;web standards&lt;/a&gt; in the rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlights at work this week included several away-days. We opened one with a vulnerability exercise: Bringing in deeply-meaningful personal items and telling their (really our) stories. We closed the day reflecting using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.praxisframework.org/en/library/lencioni&quot;&gt;Lencioni’s model&lt;/a&gt; and all cited the opening exercise as having been a big boost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consecutive away-days compressed the time available for other work. The rapid oscillation between the safety of away-day conversations &amp;amp; now-pressured (already difficult) day-job activities made this week one of the most confusing all year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although maybe &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinzoe.com/&quot;&gt;ZOE&lt;/a&gt; talking: I started the trial this week meaning sticking a glucose monitor into my arm, eating controlled foods and taking various samples. My mood is definitely a bit weird. We won’t talk about Day 2. Genuinely excited to see the results, although they’re probably a next year thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/c4d13db3-73ca-4a6d-95fd-90f358429aad?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader, I ventured back into the world this week after recovering from - &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; - I caught returning from Bulgaria. Turns out that travel can be dangerous after-all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After not running much during the trip and then staying mostly indoors for a week, I ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/8042925740&quot;&gt;once&lt;/a&gt; this week and it was a real struggle. Lesson learned: stick to the habit - &lt;em&gt;even while travelling&lt;/em&gt;. The upshot is that all my health stats are still tracking up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At work I spent a lot of time on recruitment-shaped activities for a few roles. On top of going through - &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; - of CVs, I designed a new interview process for a specialised role, leaning heavily on behavioural questions (with a few discussion-based technical questions) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/interviewing-fairly.html&quot;&gt;this GDS-inspired technique&lt;/a&gt; and so far it’s performing quite well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the evenings I’ve split my time between writing, coursework and drinking. Hoping to publish a few blog posts over the course of the rest of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This term I’m using three languages as part of my course - Python &amp;amp; JavaScript, which I’m comfortable with, and C++17 which is mostly new to me. Learning a new language, even formally (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36708350-beginning-c-17&quot;&gt;with this textbook&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing this from Sofia Airport, after a pretty intense working week. Lots of time catching up with colleagues new and old. I’m pretty wiped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Against the background symphony of assorted sniffles &amp;amp; coughs in both airports, there’ve been hardly any masks in sight. Travelling feels like a real adventure right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My main objective this week was to talk about my team’s upcoming work for 2023. We started the process remotely by sharing some docs, but discussing in-person meant we could discuss finer points (and some creative ideas) over coffees and ad-hoc walk-ups, so by the end of the week we were fully aligned. Refreshing after previous planning cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over many technical conversations, one major theme was about how to scale our enablement functions across multiple teams. Today we all repeat some of our work, e.g. Continuous Integration. More interestingly, the topic of doing native app enablement in the future came up, which is very different to anything I’ve ever done before and is…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&apos;s something quite magical about watching the sunrise from an airport lounge.  It brings a kind-of existential clarity to your priorities and your life.  The (usually) sleepless night before really helps in setting the mood to answer such difficult questions as “What am I even doing with my life?”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was beautiful though.  Wish you could have seen it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week was largely spent in spreadsheets, changing (&lt;em&gt;occasionally&lt;/em&gt; moving) cells.  And then speaking to people about the changes.  I also spent some time doing some targeted deep-dives into our tech-stack, to look at personalisation and caching logic.  A pull-request may have been produced, and subsequently rejected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M﻿y new vice this week is sudoku.  I reinstalled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.playgoodsudoku.com/&quot;&gt;Good Sudoku&lt;/a&gt; while watching the final season of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7016936/&quot;&gt;Killing Eve&lt;/a&gt;, and then a day later caught myself doing one during a slightly more talk-y meeting.  According to screentime I have over 24 hours in-game.  &lt;em&gt;Yikes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R﻿eally disappointed at where Killing Eve went BTW.  Not sure…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Working for a newspaper, it&apos;s impossible not to feel connected to the news.  But &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21836620/&quot;&gt;with Skandal!&lt;/a&gt; on everybody&apos;s lips this week, that connection feels more real than ever.  In many ways it&apos;s exciting being on the periphery of this kind of work, holding so many to account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally excited right now.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We had two fairly major (but brief) outages on the website this week.

&lt;li&gt;Two more pumpkin-spices in btw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a few years, what has stopped me from getting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://remarkable.com/&quot;&gt;Remarkable&lt;/a&gt; is the lack of backlight and lack of Kindle support.  On Thursday everything changed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-announcing-kindle-scribe&quot;&gt;the Kindle Scribe announcement&lt;/a&gt;.  I&apos;m genuinely excited about this device: It&apos;s the e-ink tablet which genuinely does…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
