                  &lt;p&gt;It’s been rather hot this week and for lack of air conditioning at home, I’ve been eating lots of spicy food – and espresso soft-serve — to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinesefoodwiki.org/Dan_Dan_Noodles&quot;&gt;Dan Dan Noodles&lt;/a&gt; (担担面) are the best things ever: A small amount of spicy soup and pork which comes out perfect nearly every time. Goes well paired with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thekitchn.com/sichuan-smashed-cucumber-salad-recipe-23173272&quot;&gt;Smashed Cucumber Salad&lt;/a&gt; (凉拌黄瓜) which — served cold and drizzled in Sichuan chilli oil — make the temperature melt away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cooklikepriya.com/2013/09/varutha-kozhi-masala-spicy-chicken.html&quot;&gt;Kozhi Varutha&lt;/a&gt; is a new discovery — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ashasrestaurant.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Asha’s&lt;/a&gt; serves a similar fish curry which is my go to whenever I’m in Birmingham, and this is even easier to make. Lots of chilli and creamy chicken: Perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foodandmeal.com/kara-miso-tonkotsu-ramen&quot;&gt;Kara-Miso Ramen&lt;/a&gt; (辛味噌ラーメン) for whatever reason isn’t that well known but is utterly delicious. I think I overdid the ginger and chilli because it came out a much deeper red, but, &lt;em&gt;oh my god&lt;/em&gt; was it good. If you’re ever in Tokyo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.co.za/Restaurant_Review-g1066443-d1698900-Reviews-Karashibimisoramen_Kikanbo_Kanda-Chiyoda_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html&quot;&gt;be sure to check out the place I discovered it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the heat however, haven’t got a whole lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For fun I’ve been writing small slack bots to automate journal entries and news digests, although maybe I should &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3xPIYHKSoI&quot;&gt;re-write them in Rust&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9660182/&quot;&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/a&gt; on Netflix was surprisingly good. Video-game stories don’t tend to work in film (&lt;em&gt;e.g. the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120804/&quot;&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/a&gt; series of movies&lt;/em&gt;) but this is a great exception. Highly recommended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you heard about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_ninth&quot;&gt;curse of the ninth&lt;/a&gt;? Wondering if Gabe Newell is worried about a curse of the third in video-games.&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;With record high temperatures in the UK, I regret moving to a place with such good insulation. Winter was wonderful and the heating stayed off, but, now I’m craving the cool touch of air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current life-hacks involve shorts and bootleg iced-coffees, which is to say refrigerated milk and whatever form of concentrated caffeine I can find.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a time to begin reading John Doerr&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://speedandscale.com/&quot;&gt;Speed &amp;amp; Scale&lt;/a&gt;. From an author known for OKRs, it’s a book with case studies and an action plan for tackling climate change. The website includes much of the same information and &lt;a href=&quot;https://speedandscale.com/tracker/&quot;&gt;an interactive tracker for each objective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy to stop eating beef, but it’s slightly disheartening to see that many big objectives are off-target: Perhaps the heat will stop us bickering and supporting populists? One can only hope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots happening at work right now, too much to mention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Tuesday &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@carolinej.is&quot;&gt;Caroline&lt;/a&gt; left our team, and we marked the occasion with our first in-person team lunch which was lovely - until we got kicked-out to make room for a networking event!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DimityrTerziev&quot;&gt;Dimitar&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; I are both taking on short-term interim tech-director roles which is exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s mid-year review season at work, and I think it’s been uplifting for everybody? I’m on-target with most of my objectives and have nice feedback which will help me (slightly) course-correct.&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/ba074770-eea7-429f-9fe2-36c19df392d7?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Last week I was preoccupied with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamesdonequick.com/&quot;&gt;SGDQ&lt;/a&gt; so didn’t write anything — this week was genuinely exhausting in a nice way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SGDQ was tonnes of fun, and in particular &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNbkv_DJ0f0&quot;&gt;Ocarina of Time: Triforce%&lt;/a&gt; is one of the genuinely coolest things I’ve ever seen. Also after contributing for years, for the first time one of my donations got announced out in front of 100k people: It felt &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the work week, the recently formed API Rationalisation team ran a in-person office-hours where they talked about their current thinking. Really cool, not only because it’s similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/d1a4a7bb-fc4d-41f2-8482-8a7afe1af0e6&quot;&gt;approach we took in FT Specialist&lt;/a&gt; and it’s always nice being validated, but because their communication style is brilliantly engaging &amp;amp; transparent in a way unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. Hoping for an eventual write-up!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every year the FT does rounders in Regents Park and this year I went along for the first time. Genuinely fantastic seeing so many people (many for the first-time) and discovering how competitive some teams were. Highlights included light gossip, discovering a secret jägerbomb bar in the bushes and being massively sunburnt. &lt;em&gt;Fairly sure I got recruited as a wedding DJ&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/6f9856e3-eef0-47c1-970b-9dc1dbaa6252?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;This week was my first time back to Sofia since repatriating and after relearning the art of crossing roads, it was brilliant seeing how well my old team are doing, catching up with friends and making some new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Saturday, in the heat I walked around the entire city through every park — including some I hadn’t visited while out there. South Park is lovely!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between catching-up &amp;amp; work, I also did a midterm exercise on Algorithms: The hardest part was revising pseudocode! 😅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately though not all was good, and politics came to a head resulting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/bulgarian-government-faces-no-confidence-vote-political-turmoil-2022-06-22/&quot;&gt;government shutdown&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile the US supreme court, in a heartbreaking regression to human rights, has put many in medical peril. RMT in the UK are also fighting for workers rights. There’s a strange energy in the air right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What brought me here was the chance to, face-to-face work with colleagues on &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/96a83745-76dc-47dc-8294-eae333aec62d&quot;&gt;the product coexistence challenge&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We ran through a list of product &amp;amp; tech capabilities and identified common themes with each around Ownership &amp;amp; Focus, Real-Estate and Enablement. These themes a great starting point for a diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing we learned was surprising, which meant we were already well aligned, but it still was useful to talk through everything. The realisation that many of our constraints aren’t technology reinforces my view that it’s all solvable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps are, continuing in a working group to draft a proposal including some suggested next actions. Part of that will include engaging a wider audience to try and build consensus, so, all-in-all kind-of exciting really.&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/3e44c675-e425-4af4-953d-2c2ed4315b27?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Recently I was lucky enough to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/leadingeng-london&quot;&gt;LeadingEng London&lt;/a&gt;, here’s what I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LeadingEng is a new conference aimed at VP/Director/CTO level engineering leaders by the organisers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a more intimate setting &amp;amp; audience, we were seated at tables with people from organisations of a similar size/area, encouraged to talk throughout the day between a single-track of interactive workshops and talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material throughout was genuinely brilliant, even if some was beyond what I’m doing today, and I walked away having learned a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. As a reference and to help digest the material of the day, I’ve written up just some of my takeaways, grouping them by the major themes: Culture &amp;amp; Relationships, Strategy &amp;amp; Prioritisation and Personal Development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Culture &amp;amp; Relationships&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy culture and relationships &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2011/03/culture-trumps-strategy-every&quot;&gt;are the foundation of everything we do&lt;/a&gt;, and without them, we won’t execute effectively. As leaders how do we cultivate culture &amp;amp; relationships that thrive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dolapo&quot;&gt;Dolapo Falola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; spoke about how culture isn’t just what we say, it’s how we act and how people behave. Healthy, inclusive culture promotes growth and improves business outcomes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/toxic-culture-is-driving-the-great-resignation/&quot;&gt;toxic culture slows results and makes people leave&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Hi reader! Gosh it’s been warm this week, and the pollen (in London, at least) has been going haywire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started taking antihistamines, which help but now there’s a whole host of other annoyances to contend with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyway in news &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; unrelated to antihistamines resulting in unpredictable sleep, I’m writing this from Heathrow airport, sipping a breakfast of a Bloody Mary. The last real all-nighter I pulled was in 2019 to get to the same airport lounge, to catch the exact same flight. How weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s all good though, I got a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of housework done and even drafted some future blog-posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the FT’s Japanese culture club invited in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urasenke.co.uk/about-us.html&quot;&gt;Urasenke&lt;/a&gt; who ran a tea ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was &lt;em&gt;Chado chakai&lt;/em&gt;, I believe, or the more casual version of the event. After a short history lesson about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urasenke.org/tradition/&quot;&gt;the arrival of tea in Japan&lt;/a&gt;, our host started talking about the cultural undertones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our whole room sat in silence, as we watched a demonstration of the ceremony itself. It didn’t have a great deal many moving parts, but that turns out to be entirely the point. Every action in the ceremony itself has deep connotations &amp;amp; people spend decades honing the art.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each ceremony is intentionally a once-in-a-lifetime, folks invite their friends, families &amp;amp; colleagues to share the experience and it’s as much a shared artistic experience, like a concert, as an occasion where folks drink tea. I’m glad I got to share this one.&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/e7bac4da-1779-4d38-842f-85e4673dfc47?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;During the week I was lucky enough to go to both &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/leadingeng-london&quot;&gt;LeadingEng&lt;/a&gt; conferences.  Huge thank-you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/efinlay24&quot;&gt;Euan&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.annashipman.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Anna&lt;/a&gt; respectively for the tickets - I otherwise wouldn&apos;t have gone, which would have been a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt;’s name is definitely unintuitive: I’d recommend it to &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; mid &amp;amp; senior level engineers as a flavour of what sorts of things tech-leads &amp;amp; engineering-managers are doing, as well as a guide on how to progress to either.  It’s also pointer to the wealth of excellent resources that now exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I last went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/&quot;&gt;LeadDev&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 and at the time, as a recently-minted tech-lead, I found the content super-stretchy &amp;amp; valuable.  Several years later, some of the talks feel less relevant but I cannot understate how excellent &amp;amp; helpful it still was.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leaddev.com/leadingeng-london&quot;&gt;LeadingEng&lt;/a&gt; on Friday was exactly the progression it promised to be.  Sitting at a table of directors &amp;amp; CTOs, there were a few moments where I felt (pleasantly) out of my depth.  I’m definitely writing up some of the things I learned - consider this note public accountability!&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/96a83745-76dc-47dc-8294-eae333aec62d?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Slowly getting back to normal this week, just in time to remember that over the past few years I’ve been developing hay-fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No running (yet) this week.  It’s the Platinum Jubilee so it was a short 3-day week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spent some time reviewing fracture planes with a view to applying them to (hopefully) enable some several teams to work together in harmony.  Many things about this work are quite exciting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Wednesday I went to a lunch with Fastly which was nice, not only because Fastly are a lovely collection of humans, but, because we learned about how other companies approach some of the same challenges that we’re facing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, all of Great Britain has been celebrating the 43rd anniversary of the London Underground’s Jubilee line, which first opened in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originally the line was named after the River Fleet, its colour was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_gray#Battleship_gray&quot;&gt;battleship-gray&lt;/a&gt; and it was planned to run next to the Fleet through the City of London.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To avoid evoking the wrath of rival River Thames, after delays in building a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier&quot;&gt;defensive Barrier&lt;/a&gt;, in 1977 the line was renamed.  That year happened to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Jubilee_of_Elizabeth_II&quot;&gt;Silver Jubilee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_gray#Battleship_gray&quot;&gt;Battleship-gray&lt;/a&gt; is visually similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_gray#Silver&quot;&gt;Silver&lt;/a&gt;, so after some hurried sign repainting, the name Jubilee quickly stuck.&lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Week two of Covid: Last Saturday was the peak of my symptoms, and one long week later, I&apos;m feeling somewhere between 93-96%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every day &lt;a href=&quot;https://ouraring.com/&quot;&gt;Oura&lt;/a&gt; has reported a slightly healthier temperature, respiratory-rate &amp;amp; heart-rate-variability. The long-tail shows how gradual the recovery has been.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major symptoms were a dry-cough (which became a wet cough the next day), a five-day-long headache, fatigue (which hasn&apos;t gone entirely yet).  Oh, and sneezing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-sneezing&quot;&gt;which is how I know the vaccine is still doing something&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point I stopped being able to smell anything, which is a story involving food that I&apos;d really rather not go into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation has been interesting: Even without the mandate I haven&apos;t felt well enough to go outdoors or do anything particularly strenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone on a video-call was walking from Euston to Paddington, which was great &amp;amp; felt like my own private livestream.  Yes, I live in this city, but it&apos;s still cool to see the sights from my living room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspired by a good friend&apos;s advice, I finally switched (downgraded?) from an eGPU to a Plugable dock. It has made a world of positive difference to work-from-home setup: While some software is slower, everything is way more stable - and my setup is miles smaller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ran a bit too far right before coming down with Covid, so this has forced me to recover my legs/knees a bit.  I&apos;ve been encouraged to rest a bit longer, so I&apos;ll do that, and reset my programme.&lt;/li&gt;…&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Writing from my sofa in PJs: This week started out okay, and then I came down with Covid-19.  So now my life is rewatching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/&quot;&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess I won&apos;t &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/a5d000d1-b899-4ebd-b102-c33d86e8001a&quot;&gt;see you at J&apos;s drinks&lt;/a&gt; after-all!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
