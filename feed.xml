                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cherry blossom season is upon us, and it’s gorgeous.  The parks are chokka.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said of the weather: It has been cold, and dark, and damp, and miserable all week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between the weather and immediately jumping back into work, even though it was a few days, I was suffering a proper holiday hangover this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many years ago I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919&quot;&gt;“Working Effectively with Legacy Code”&lt;/a&gt;, and it excited me to work with gnarly codebases.  Well, let’s just say I burned a lot of that excitement this week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After missing 3 lessons in a row, Japanese class was &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; rough.  We made it, in the end, but wow there were moments where I doubted myself.  Who’d have guessed that learning a language is hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very thought provoking catch-up on Wednesday evening. 😅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had a university final during the week.  It caught me by surprise, but luckily it was in an area I know well.  Finished with hours to spare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omiyage of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_cake&quot;&gt;sweetheart cake&lt;/a&gt; (老婆餅) was very well received.  I had a spare which I stuck…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/d12df8f8-cc9d-4463-a51b-fc44dad1e16e?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If last week marked my first serious travel since the big move, this week marked my proper first holiday - and with it, more travel.  Thursday was a bank holiday and together with Friday made for an extended “long weekend”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum height: 332.6m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kowloon Dairy products consumed: 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After work on Tuesday evening I went to the top of Landmark 81 - the tallest building in Vietnam, the 2nd tallest in SEA and the 17th tallest in the world. It is also, by at least 100 meters, the highest I have ever been.  Reaching the top, they strapped me to a pole and let me walk right up to the edge, where I took a few precarious photos and a selfie, right before scurrying right back down to ground level.  Gorgeous view though, well worth the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrestled with some NodeJS meta-programming which I really didn&apos;t enjoy. Sometimes I think we had it good with n-gage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on Wednesday, REDACTED.  All I’m saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday I packed up, picked up some laundry, had some emergency banh mi, and swatted away the biggest cockroach you ever did see, before collapsing into an airplane seat.  Onboard I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8368368&quot;&gt;The Apprentice (2024)&lt;/a&gt;, which I really rate, it’s a very good movie.  Solid 3/5.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b2f53898-7914-40dc-b0a9-40f75e49b09a?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was spent in Ho Chi Minh City 🇻🇳 for both a business trip, and my first trip outside of Tokyo since the big move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌞 Average temperature: 31°C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌫️ Average humidity 67.36%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤢 Cockroaches spotted: 34&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday begins mega early in Narita and possibly the slowest airport check in I’ve ever done.  Nearly an hour.  Thankfully the rest of the journey to the gate was speedy, but, reader, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that this felt mega dicey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately on landing I’m struck by the heat.  It’s hot.  It’s so hot that every minute feels like five.  By the time we get to a taxi my brain has nearly adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first meal is Phở at a local place, and it ends up being one of the tastiest meals of the week as well as due to my choice of toppings probably the least healthy.  We get oodles of free vegetables which - coming from Tokyo - is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikes.  Bikes everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many of us colocated in the same space for the first time in a while, we ran through lots of workshops ranging from talking about our backgrounds to experiencing what it’s like for users to use one of our products.  Great energy all around and I enjoyed the time with people I don’t normally work with.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/c7240558-389b-4c05-ae04-09839bf081ca?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hello from Narita.  I took three trains and a bus to get here — normally it’s only one train — so, not in a great mood.  Hopefully tomorrow’s breakfast will make the journey worth it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With next week being my first real travel since moving to Japan, this week was all about working through a shopping list and a todo list of preparation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It snowed on Tuesday!  Proper snow!  In March!  I don’t even own snow boots anymore!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepping a workshop for next week really didn’t take long.  Finding the right brand of insect spray, surprisingly, did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For lack of having the ingredients, to celebrate Pancake Day I bought some premade pancakes, some honey and some sour cream.  It wasn’t until too late in the process that I realised I’d made glorified doriyaki, reader, but damn were they good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still running!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it me or is there a secret second last train which doesn’t appear on the train timetable, immediately after the last train?  It’s either that or I believed a bunch of ghosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phrase “cost…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/0297a9c9-c802-45c1-99a9-8b09fd099349?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the week when I tried every single commodity LLM, and a few other things we’re labelling “AI”.  And let me tell you, oh boy have my opinions on AI flip-flopped like the integrity of a career politician. More on &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers read: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance run: 13.29km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigs attended: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it mildly, it really hasn’t been a good week from a current affairs perspective. On Thursday I started writing a message to someone and by the time I sent it on Sunday I had to redraft it, twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been a good week for paperwork on Planet Alex.  I signed the lease for my long-term apartment this week, which was a much more involved process than any other contract signing I’ve ever done, including the ones through [&lt;em&gt;name of a random previous employer&lt;/em&gt;]’s procurement system.  10 sheets of A3 paper.  My &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; agent even had a pen and a bottle of water ready for my troubles.  If anyone is looking for property in Tokyo, I will definitely connect you, please ask.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/884e3748-4fa8-4d6d-a261-684f3ac848fb?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headline this week is that I moved at the weekend.  Goodbye Shibaura and hello Azabu.  It’s a considerably different experience: Some streets round here don&apos;t feel like Tokyo.  And amongst other things, I traded a work desk for a dining table.  I haven’t had a dining table since August 2021.  Now my breakfasts feel somehow dignified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Papers read: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distance run: 10.82km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gigs attended: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class is going well.  We formally began the Kanji.  At some point I have learned to handwrite most of the katakana and hiragana.  And at Tuesday lunchtime I managed to order in a non-English-speaking restaurant without any aids, and it didn’t &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; very awkward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second month in a row that I’m deep-cleaning a flat.  This one was a bit easier at least: Three months is a lot less than four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA helped me move by renting a van and helping me shift 3 bags, 2 suitcases and 1 box all in one go.  This was by far the easiest inter-city move I’ve ever done — the hard part was sourcing the bags — and I hope the next one goes just as smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b0430239-285c-4f63-b620-731c634aaa08?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a pretty good week.  I had a moment where I thought back to a question someone asked me, and I realised, that I couldn’t fault a single day this week.  Considering the number of big changes that have happened in the past 12 weeks alone, that&apos;s pretty huge.  This felt good in a calm way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚶 Distance walked: 115,895 steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧉 Jasmine tea drunk: 3 litres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve an incredibly annoying migration problem in a repeatable way, I wrote some code which parses the ES AST to extract its exports.  And, it, worked?  Normally I don’t do something so low-level and cursed until &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; summer?  So I’m pretty chuffed with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had two stand-out work lunches, only one of which was probably unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got accepted for the apartment I applied for, which is &lt;em&gt;wonderful&lt;/em&gt; news, but the move-in date is a little ways off.  So during the week I signed another short-term lease, this one for a flat in Minami-Azabu.  It’s not the most convenient for going to other parts of Tokyo, but it’s an extremely nice area I’ve always enjoyed passing through, and being just on the cusp of walkable to work, I’ll probably never again have the opportunity to stay there.  I’m mega excited to explore a new neighbourhood.  Move-in next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/dbadbdda-2f45-4088-ab21-82f809d87b50?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class update: Katakana are happening and they’re happening fast.  I’m staying (mostly) on top of vocab, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning katakana &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; making grocery shopping significantly easier, mind.  I finally found oatmeal, and in case the picture wasn’t enough, I know enough letters to now know that it says “OATMEAL”.  So that’s neat.  Lessons are already paying for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍣 Sushi consumed: 21 pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🥣 Oatmeal consumed: 270g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my periodic LinkedIn doomscrolling (to reach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/games&quot;&gt;their daily puzzle games&lt;/a&gt; I must open the feed) I read an incredibly bad take that using emdashes is a tell-tale sign of the use of artificial intelligence in writing, because obviously nobody uses emdashes.  I remember being taught to use them in school, but, unfortunately, I do not remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;.  Nonetheless I continue to use them.  I hope the inaccuracies are proof enough that, at least for now, my posts are still hand-cranked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of joining a new job is learning how the goal-setting and evaluation systems work, and I’ve just about crossed that threshold this week by setting my half-yearly objectives.  I’m quite happy with the approach, and the output.&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexwilson.tech/content/b91a5f27-b922-428d-9cb2-58daa9d17911?utm_source=feed&quot;&gt;Read the full post here...&lt;/a&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new lunar year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week in data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🍣 Time taken to eat Ehomaki: 682.33 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;☁️ Average humidity: 27%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a few delightful catch-ups with people outside my team this week, so I’m feeling like I’m starting to settle in better — but there’s still a lot of things for me to learn, as well as some cultural differences to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t normally do this sort of thing, but I’ve been using Endel (a soundscape app, e.g. for concentration, for activity, for sleep, etc.) - and I’m finding it incredibly good.  I&apos;ve used similar apps in the past - this generates music (not AI, dw), instead of playing back pre-recorded tracks, so it feels relatively fresh and non-repetitive.  My default soundscape has become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHRi_4rBcEM&quot;&gt;Richie Hawtin’s collaboration&lt;/a&gt; which I genuinely love.  This isn’t a referral-driven recommendation, but I do have &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.endel.io/?code=16hsnko&quot;&gt;a referral code/voucher which nets you a 14-day trial&lt;/a&gt; (regularly 7-days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather is currently incredibly cold and also incredibly dry which is not doing good things to my skin.  To combat it, I went out and bought a humidifier and paired it with my IR hub - so now I have the ability to remotely heat and humidify my flat.  It seems to be helping?&lt;/p&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

                  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This week brought the fabled health-check, of Instagram/TikTok/YouTube creator fame.  I hate to shatter the illusion† but it turns out to be a series of tests and measures to assess overall health, much like in many other countries (other than, for some reason, the UK).  To all you fellow-watchers of American sitcoms, it’s  &quot;&quot;&quot;a physical&quot;&quot;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But the REAL headline of the week is: Monday I showed up bright and early at the Shibaura-konan ward office to finally collect my MyNumber card. The whole process was pretty fast: I had to review some documents, set some passwords and then I walked out with the future of paperwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starting to think that Next.JS belongs in the same part of my resume as Magento, IYKWIM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At work we had a new-starter lunch with leadership, which gave the opportunity to submit questions ahead of time.  Thinking they would be anonymised, filtered or moderated, I submitted far too many to count.  I came to regret this — because on the print-outs I saw that nearly all…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
