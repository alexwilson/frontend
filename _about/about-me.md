            My name is Alex, and I'm a driven full-stack software engineer on a mission to deliver superb experiences to both developers and users alike.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy playing videogames and watching both TV and film, but most often can be found reading or tinkering with computers, servers or code.

            Professionally I'm a full-stack software engineer specialising in DevOps and backend web-development, but I am proficient in other forms of development, and am very experienced with the use and administration of UNIX(*BSD, OSX) and UNIX-like (Gentoo and Debian-like preferred) systems. Check out <a href="https://stormbit.net">StormBit</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/antoligy">my Github profile</a> to see some of the things I'm behind.
